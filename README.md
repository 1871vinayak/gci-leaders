### Note
You require `npm v5.8.0` which needs to be installed explicitly using
```
npm i npm@5.8.0 -g
```
`npm v5.8.0` is the latest release of npm which properly supports optional dependencies, so it won't download extra bits that are not needed, which can help in reducing data downloads.
***
### Installation
```
npm install
```
***
### Languages:
* Node.js
* JSON
