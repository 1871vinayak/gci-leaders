For the sake of this example, I've used BitBucket as the tooling provider, as that is likely to be our interim toolset for the reasons outlined above. However, one can easily imagine these functions being substituted for their equivalents in other toolsets.</p> <p>The following is <strong>only an early concept</strong>. These are by no means final designs for each of these integration points, but they will help to visualize how these tools will be integrated with Drupal.org.</p> <p><strong>Mockup: Workspaces in the issue summary</strong></p> <p>The biggest change for contributors would be the addition of a new place in the issue summary to contain these workspaces. For most issues we anticipate a single workspace, as most issues are resolved via collaboration on a single code path, however we would be able to generate multiple workspaces per issue for multiple solutions being proposed in parallel:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Code workspace in issue summary\" height=\"174\" src=\"/files/proposed-code-table.png\" width=\"643\" /></p> <p>The key functions of the Proposed code workspace are: the ability to make a new workspace, the ability to clone an existing workspace, the ability to create/view/edit a workspace merge request. The latest test result and ad-hoc testing options for each workspace would be provided here as well.</p> <p><strong>Mockup: Propose new Code</strong></p> <p>The \"Propose new code\" button is very simply a way to automatically generate a new workspace. This would only be used when a contributor wants to propose an alternate solution to whatever is currently under development. When pressed, we would generate a new workspace with the back-end tooling provider (whether as a fork, branch, or Git namespace) and add it to the table to be cloned, viewed for comments/inline editing, or ultimately to create a new merge request.</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"A second workspace in the issue summary\" height=\"213\" src=\"/files/proposed-code%20-table-two.png\" width=\"657\" /></p> <p>The new workspace will be generated with a name based on the issue id, and will present its own test result, clone, and merge request features.</p> <p>If a user wants to collaborate on an existing solution instead, they can simply clone that workspace locally, or view it to make inline edits. Because some issues can languish for months, or even years, we also want to automate the process of rebasing these workspaces from their parents.</p> <p><strong>Mockup: Automatic comments as workspaces are updated</strong></p> <p>Whenever a change is made within the third party toolset, we would use the API to call back to Drupal.org and leave a system message describing the change, as well as linking to the relevant part of the third party toolset UI.</p> <p>This is what an automated issue comment for code review might look like:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"hestenet commented on 2893061-0 - &quot;This is just a test comment&quot; Read more...\" height=\"75\" src=\"/files/drupal-issue-comment-notification.png\" width=\"630\" /></p> <p>This is what a comment for recently pushed changes would look like:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"hestenet pushed code to: 2893061-0: View the diff This is a commit messag. Read more...\" height=\"73\" src=\"/files/drupal-org-code-push-notification.png\" width=\"627\" /></p> <p>And this is what a comment for inline edits could look like:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"hestenet used the inline editor to update 2893061-1: drupal/core/modules/update/update.api.php - View the diff\" height=\"96\" src=\"/files/drupalorg-inline-edit-notification.png\" width=\"630\" /></p> <p><strong>Mockup: Clone</strong></p> <p>The clone button would simply provide a basic modal pop-up with instructions for collaborators to clone the workspace locally with Git. This is not the final url pattern (one of our goals is to avoid changes in canonical git urls where possible) but it could look something like this:</p> <p><em>$ git clone <a href=\"ssh://git@bb.drupalcode.org/is/drupal.git\">ssh://git@bb.drupalcode.org/is/drupal.git</a></em><em> </em></p> <p><strong>Mockup: Create Merge Request (in BitBucket)</strong></p> <p>Merge requests allow contributors to propose changes to projects they don't maintain, and provide maintainers an easy way to view proposed changes.</p> <p>The create merge request button would allow the user to view the current workspace and request that it be merged into the canonical parent. Only a project maintainer would have the permissions to complete the merge.</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Create pull request\" height=\"534\" src=\"/files/create-pull-request.png\" width=\"1267\" /></p> <p>Code in a workspace with an open pull request can continue to be iterated on by the contributors. Code comments, diffs, and reviews are summarized on the request.</p> <p><strong>Mockup: View Merge Request (in BitBucket)</strong></p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"View existing merge request\" height=\"479\" src=\"/files/view-merge-request.png\" width=\"1048\" /></p> <p>View merge request, like 'create merge request' would allow any collaborator to view the current workspace. This could also be used to initiate inline code edits, or leave code comments.</p> <p><strong>Mockup: Inline editing</strong></p> <p>Inline editing allows a quick and easy way for people to propose \"standalone\" changes to e.g. documentation, markup, etc. without having to have an entire development stack.</p> <p>We would rely on the third party tooling provider's inline editing functionality. In the example below, we can see how an inline edit is made using BitBucket:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Inline editor\" height=\"350\" src=\"/files/inline-editor_0.png\" width=\"588\" /></p> <p><strong>Mockup: Code review</strong></p> <p>As with inline editing, we would rely on the third-party tooling provider's tools for code review. In the example below you can see the code review options provided by BitBucket:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Code review tools and comments\" height=\"531\" src=\"/files/Inline-code-comnents.png\" width=\"554\" /></p> <p>As indicated above, these mockups are simply an illustration of what this integration could look like, not final designs. However, this has hopefully shown how we can introduce a hybrid model to integrate the best features of a third party tooling provider (pull requests, code review, inline editing), while retaining the essential nature of the drupal-flow.</p> <div class=\"note-version\"> <h4>In our next post:</h4> <p><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-4-whats-next\">We outline our roadmap for this initiative</a>.</p> </div> </div></div></div>","published":"2017-12-20T17:37:12.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-3-illustrating-modular-integration-for-developer","feed":{"source":"https://www.drupal.org/planet/rss.xml","link":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","name":"Drupal.org aggregator"}},{"title":"Drupal.org blog: Developer Tools Initiative - Part 2: Comparing our options","content":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"left\" height=\"238\" src=\"/files/git-icon_0.png\" width=\"150\" />This is the second post in our series about integrating Drupal.org with a 3rd party developer tooling provider:</p> <ul><li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-1-the-criteria\">Where we stand now, and our evaluation criteria</a>.</li> <li>The options we considered. <strong>← you are here</strong></li> <li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-3-illustrating-modular-integration-for-developer\">An illustration of what Drupal.org integration with a 3rd party tooling provider could look like</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-4-whats-next\">Our implementation plan for this initiative</a>.</li> </ul><p>In this update we'll talk about the specific options we've been evaluating to improve the tools for developers on Drupal.org. For each of these options we've built prototype workflows, stood up test integrations, and opened a dialogue with the creators of these toolsets about any gaps we identified. You'll see a summary of how each tooling option does or does not live up to the criteria we outlined in our last post.</p> <h3>Issue Workspaces</h3> <p>At DrupalCon Los Angeles in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/mixologic\">Mixologic</a> from the DA Engineering team proposed the concept of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg/issues/2488266\">Issue Workspaces</a>. While we've historically talked about this idea as a single concept, it actually breaks down into two key components:</p> <ol><li>The definition of a modern, idealized workflow for the Drupal project.</li> <li>A technical implementation using a bespoke tooling solution built on Git Namespaces to implement this workflow.</li> </ol><p><strong>Criteria (for a bespoke implementation):</strong></p> <ul><li>Familiar workflow. <ul><li>❌/<strong><span style=\"font-size:2em;color:orange;font-weight:bold\">⸗</span></strong> While an implementation of workspaces based on a bespoke git-namespaces implementation has <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg/issues/2488266\">several technical advantages</a>, it will not appear nearly as familiar to outside developers as a more standard 'pull request' implementation. (Though it would be functionally very similar). </li> </ul></li> <li>Preserve the most valuable parts of Drupal's workflow. <ul><li><strong><span style=\"font-size:2em;color:green;font-weight:bold\">✔</span></strong>By implementing a bespoke solution we could exactly tailor the solution to the needs of the Drupal community.</li> <li>❌ However, the needs of that community are great, and our <em>capacity</em> to build a 100% bespoke solution that meets all the community's needs is not clear.</li> </ul></li> <li>Leverage a partner who will keep evolving their code collaboration featureset. <ul><li>❌ Building issue workspaces using a bespoke git namespaces implementation would require us to continuously compete on features with major third party tooling providers that have much greater resources.</li> </ul></li> </ul><p>A purely bespoke implementation misses the mark on two of our three primary criteria. Fortunately, however, two years after the original proposal, it is no longer necessary to build a bespoke solution in order to implement an idealized workflow for the Drupal project. It is something that can be done by integrating the existing Drupal.org project pages and issue queues with third-party tooling solutions. Leveraging third party solutions provides several advantages including: familiarity to a wider audience of developers, a continually evolving featureset, and mitigation of the risks of maintaining a bespoke solution with a small team of engineers.</p> <p>Here is the idealized 'Drupal-flow' visualized:</p> <p class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Drupal Flow - the interaction between issues and workspaces\" height=\"641\" src=\"/files/drupal-flow.png\" width=\"813\" /></p> <ul><li>Every issue should be associated with one or more canonical workspaces (git repos+merge requests) which can be collaborated on by any contributor, and merged into the canonical parent by a project maintainer.</li> <li>Contributors should be able to modify the code in these workspaces by: <ul><li>Checking out the code and committing/pushing changes to the workspace.</li> <li>Inline editing files within a workspace.</li> <li>Legacy: uploading a patch.</li> <li>Any contribution method should trigger the appropriate tests.</li> </ul></li> <li>Workspaces should be rebased (manually or automatically) on any changes to the canonical parent.</li> </ul><p>This workflow is not dissimilar to the default <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/\">GitHub flow</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/gitlab_flow.html\">GitLab flow</a>, or even the suggested <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows\">BitBucket flow</a>. These are all variations of the generic concept of '<a href=\"http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/\">Git flow</a>' created by <a href=\"http://nvie.com/about/\">Vincent Driessen</a>. However, the important difference comes in how each of these solutions tries to integrate a gitflow model into their issue/pull-request model.</p> <p>The dominant model of these large third party tooling providers is not particularly collaborative. It encourages forks-of-forks, separates conversation about potential solutions onto multiple branch comments or merge requests threads, and generally caters to single developers working on individual proposed solutions, with one ultimately selected by the maintainer and the rest thrown away.</p> <p>This is a key area in which the 'Drupal-flow' differs from the standard workflow that is implicitly enforced by these toolsets. Our ethos encourages collaboration of many developers on a single solution, and a single threaded conversation.</p> <p>The gitflow behind the scenes may be identical, but the user experience wrapped around that flow makes very different assumptions about how people will collaborate.</p> <h3>GitHub<img alt=\"GitHub\" class=\"right\" height=\"89\" src=\"/files/github-alpha.png\" width=\"360\" /></h3> <p>GitHub is of course the dominant player in the open-source tooling space. For many years though, their toolset was very much targeted at smaller open-source projects, and their default workflow highly encourages a many-to-many, forks-of-forks workflow, rather than the many-to-one single-threaded collaboration that is part of the Drupal community's ethos. More recently, GitHub has been <a href=\"https://github.com/features\">improving their featureset</a>, providing better issue management tools, more control over organization-level namespaces, and a new app marketplace that allows developers to extend GitHub's core featureset.</p> <p>We reached out to GitHub and spoke with members of the technical and partnership teams, and while they were excited by the idea of bringing a project like Drupal to GitHub, we did run into some unresolvable blockers - most critically, by policy GitHub does not allow users of GitHub Enterprise to run their own public instances. This means we would have to migrate Drupal projects to GitHub.com, rather than self-hosting our instance.</p> <p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p> <ul><li>Familiar workflow <ul><li><span style=\"font-size:2em;color:green;font-weight:bold\">✔</span> GitHub is unquestionably the dominant platform for code collaboration on the web today.</li> </ul></li> <li>Preserve the most valuable parts of Drupal's unique workflow <ul><li>❌ No way to enforce Drupal.org as the home of projects.

In contrast to GitHub, GitLab's terms would allow us to run our own instance of the service. GitLab's fundamental workflow is very much like GitHub's - a one-to-many model of forks of forks. After <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34303#note_37495354\">discussing our workflow with their engineers</a> GitLab has begun implementing their new 'fork network' feature, allowing merge requests across forks. However, this doesn't quite achieve the goal of allowing our many-to-one collaboration model just yet.</p> <p>GitLab is <em>very close</em> to being a good solution for an Open Source project of Drupal's scale, and the rate at which they are improving the service is impressive. GitLab is also already a favorite of many in our community for personal or professional projects. Given some more time, it may ultimately be able to tick all the boxes.</p> <p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p> <ul><li>Familiar workflow <ul><li><span style=\"font-size:2em;color:green;font-weight:bold\">✔</span> GitLab's workflow is very similar to GitHub's and it is the second most widely used code collaboration toolset.</li> </ul></li> <li>Preserve the most valuable parts of Drupal's unique workflow <ul><li>❌ <strong>Hard Blocker </strong>- Maintainers <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/22292\">cannot yet collaborate on downstream merge requests</a></li> <li>❌ Monolithic toolset - GitLab's featureset is designed to be used in an all or nothing way.

Atlassian products are well known in software development circles, but they are often more <em>tolerated</em> than <em>beloved</em>. However, when we sat down at Midwest Drupal Summit in August and looked at the options we explored so far and found them to be not quite baked - BitBucket began to show some advantages as a solution.</p> <p>For one thing, BitBucket has recently put a heavy focus on user experience and collaboration features. It also has the most flexible permissions model for control over branch permissions, forking, and automatic rebasing of any of the toolsets we evaluated. Finally, it can be implemented modularly - allowing us to use the components that serve our workflow and disable the ones that don't.</p> <p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p> <ul><li><span style=\"font-size:2em;color:green;font-weight:bold\">✔</span>/<span style=\"font-size:2em;color:orange;font-weight:bold\">⸗</span> Familiar workflow <ul><li>BitBucket implements a very standard pull request workflow.

Improvements to our tools are an opportunity to remove friction to changes, increase the quality of changes, improve velocity of changes, and make contributing to Drupal delightful.</p> <p>The initiative began in coordination with Drupal Association Staff, the Technical Advisory Committee, and a small group of volunteers from the community. We <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/technical-advisory-committee-formed-to-modernize-developer-tools\">first announced</a> the initiative in October of 2016, and provided our <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/technical-advisory-committee-update\">last update</a> at the end of April of this year. Since that time a great deal of work has been underway to evaluate and prototype our options, collaborate with the vendors who supply these toolsets, and make some decisions about the direction we want to move in, with more data in hand.</p> <p>Buckle up! Because this is such a large topic we've broken it into multiple posts:</p> <ul><li>Where we stand now, and our evaluation criteria. <strong>← you are here</strong></li> <li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-2-comparing-our-options\">The options we considered</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-3-illustrating-modular-integration-for-developer\">An illustration of what Drupal.org integration with a 3rd party tooling provider could look like</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-4-whats-next\">Our implementation plan for this initiative</a>.</li> </ul><p><strong>Want a <a href=\"/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-4-whats-next#tldr\">TLDR</a>?</strong></p> <h2>Where do we stand now?</h2> <p>Drupal is one of the longest-running open source projects on the web, and for more than 15 years (and many more to come), Drupal.org has been the home of the project. Over the years, we've built a developer toolset to serve the unique needs of the project. These tools have evolved as the open source environment changed. Right now, we use a combination of best-of-breed third party technologies, such as Git, Jenkins, Fastly, OpsGenie, integrated with our own bespoke tools, including issue queues, project pages, etc.</p> <p>Right now, some of the third party and bespoke tools that we are using are market leading, whereas others have fallen behind. For example, CGIT (third party) and the patch workflow (bespoke) have both fallen behind compared to toolsets that can be found on other tooling providers. On the other hand, our issue crediting system (bespoke) is market leading, and a model for other projects to follow.</p> <p>In the end, we will always be negotiating a balance between what we can do uniquely well with bespoke solutions, and integrating the latest and greatest of third party solutions as they coalesce around best practices that we want to adopt as well.</p> <p>At DrupalCon Vienna it was decided that the Technical Advisory Committee had fulfilled their threefold mandate:</p> <ul><li>Helping the technical leadership transition on the DA engineering team after the downsizing in summer of 2016.</li> <li>Helping manage the prioritization and scope of work.</li> <li>Making recommendations to the board and DA staff on key initiatives, such as the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/goodbye-project-applications-hello-security-advisory-opt-in\">project application process changes</a>, and the direction to take with our developer tools.</li> </ul><p>We want to thank <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick\">Angie Byron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/spf13\">Steve Francia</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman\">Moshe Weitzman</a> for serving on the committee. From here, DA engineering staff will carry the torch, though we will continue to rely on the individuals who were part of the TAC and other volunteers for feedback and help from time to time as we move forward.</p> <h2>Our evaluation</h2> <p>The most recent phase of this initiative was an evaluation of the leading contenders for open source tooling providers that Drupal.org could integrate with. These options were <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>, and after setting out to develop prototypes for these options, we added BitBucket to the list as well. For each of these options we built MVP prototypes, either as integrations with Drupal.org development environments, or with private organizations/repositories. Finally, we wanted to compare these options to the bespoke <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg/issues/2488266\">Issue Workspaces</a> solution that we had proposed several years ago.</p> <h3>The Criteria</h3> <p>For the Developer Tools initiative to be successful we have to understand the criteria for improvement. From a user requirements point of view, contrib and core developers are unique stakeholders with unique requirements. Ideally we want a solution that increases velocity for both types of users, without fundamentally sacrificing the needs of one or the other.</p> <ul><li>Adopt a developer workflow that will be familiar to the millions of developers outside our community.</li> <li>Preserve those unique elements of how we collaborate that have made the Drupal project so successful. <ul><li>Many-to-one collaboration: that is to say, many developers collaborating on a single solution to a problem.</li> <li><a href=\"/issue-queue/how-to\">Issue workflow</a>.</li> <li>Picking up on long standing issues where other collaborators left off.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/a-guide-to-issue-credits-and-the-drupal.org-marketplace\">Contribution credit</a>.</li> </ul></li> <li>If possible, leverage an expert partner who will help keeping our tooling up to date as open source collaboration tools continue to evolve.</li> </ul><p>There are also some technical requirements that came out of our evaluation process.</p> <ul><li>Retention of our data/ability to migrate. <ul><li>Where possible, retain existing Git remote urls for projects.</li> </ul></li> <li>Maintainability for a small staff.</li> <li>Project maintainer management: including abandoned project reassignment, fork control, security release management, etc.</li> </ul><p>In terms of features, we were looking for:</p> <ul><li>Merge/pull requests.</li> <li>Code review.</li> <li>Inline editing.</li> <li>Branch permissioning to allow collaboration on merge/pull requests.</li> <li>Administrative tools for managing project maintainership.</li> <li>Project management tools that equal or exceed what we have with the issue queues.*</li> <li>Extensibility, so that we can preserve areas where the Drupal project is a market leader, such as with our contribution credit system.</li> </ul><p><em>*Our tools for issues are very sophisticated on an individual issue level, however we are sorely lacking in tools for grouping and prioritizing sets of issues, ie: issue boards.</em></p> <p>Finally, cost:</p> <ul><li>Given the care with which we must use our funding from the community, any option we consider must be cost neutral with the current cost of maintaining our tools.</li> </ul><p>It's difficult to condense the scope of our evaluation into a short blog series, but in the following posts we'll talk about how the options we considered measured up to these criteria, what implementing one of these options could look like for Drupal.org, and our suggested implementation roadmap.</p> <div

CSS is not my strong suit, so I wanted to get some help from a <em>CSS linter</em>. A CSS lint tool parses your CSS code and flags signs of inefficiency, stylistic inconsistencies, and patterns that may be erroneous. </p><p>I tried <a href=\"https://stylelint.io\">Stylelint</a>, an open source CSS linter written in JavaScript that is maintained as an <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com\">npm package</a>. It was quick and easy to install on my local development environment:</p> <pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm install -g stylelint stylelint-config-standard stylelint-no-browser-hacks</code></pre> <p>The <code>-g</code> attribute instructs npm to install the packages globally, the <code>stylelint-config-standard</code> is a standard configuration file (more about that in a second), and the <code>stylelint-no-browser-hacks</code> is an optional Stylelint plugin.</p> <p>Stylelint has over 150 rules to catch invalid CSS syntax, duplicates, etc. What is interesting about Stylelint is that it is completely unopinionated; all the rules are disabled by default. Configuring <a href=\"https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules\">all 150+ rules</a> would be very time-consuming. Fortunately you can use the example <code>stylelint-config-standard</code> configuration file as a starting point. This configuration file is maintained as a separate npm package. Instead of having to configure all 150+ rules, you can start with the <code>stylelint-config-standard</code> configuration file and overwrite the standard configuration with your own configuration file. In my case, I created a configuration file called <code>stylelint.js</code> in my Drupal directory.</p> <pre><code class=\"language-json line-numbers\">\"use strict\" module.exports = { \"extends\": \"stylelint-config-standard\", \"plugins\": [ \"stylelint-no-browser-hacks/lib\" ], \"rules\": { \"block-closing-brace-newline-after\": \"always\", \"color-no-invalid-hex\": true, \"indentation\": 2, \"property-no-unknown\": true, \"plugin/no-browser-hacks\": [true, { \"browsers\": [ \"last 2 versions\", \"ie >=8\" ] }], \"max-empty-lines\": 1, \"value-keyword-case\": \"lower\", \"at-rule-empty-line-before\": null, \"rule-empty-line-before\": null, }, }</code></pre> <p>As you can see, the configuration file is a JSON file. I've extended <code>stylelint-config-standard</code> and overwrote the <code>indentation</code> rule to be 2 spaces instead of tabs, for example.</p> <p>To check your CSS file, you can run Stylelint from the command line:</p> <pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ stylelint --config stylelint.js --config-basedir /usr/local/lib/node_modules/ css/album.css</code></pre> <p>Stylelint will point out errors, automatically fix some stylistic violations, or highlight where your rules are violated. In my case it found an error that was easy to fix:</p> <figure itemprop=\"image\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\"><img itemprop=\"contentUrl\" src=\"https://dri.es/files/images/blog/stylelint-album-css.jpg\" width=\"743\" height=\"76\" alt=\"Stylelint album css\" title=\"Stylelint album css\" class=\"image-no-resize\" /><link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://dri.es/files/images/blog/stylelint-album-css.jpg\" /><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"743\" /><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"76\" /></figure><p>For fun, I googled \"Stylelint Drupal\" and found that <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/alexpott\">Alex Pott</a> has proposed <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2865971\">adding a Stylelint configuration file to Drupal core</a>. <em>Seems useful to me!</em></p>","published":"2017-12-20T15:29:49.000Z","author":"","link":"https://dri.es/clean-css-with-stylelint","feed":{"source":"https://www.drupal.org/planet/rss.xml","link":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","name":"Drupal.org aggregator"}},{"title":"Canonical welcome Spotify as a snap for Linux users","content":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82417\" src=\"https://insights.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/660e/Screenshot_from_2017-12-18_12-18-27.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1399\" height=\"787\" /><br />\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Universal Linux app packaging format enables Linux users to install the popular music streaming service with a simple click and install</span></i></p>\n<p><b>London, UK – December 20th</b><b>, 2017 – </b><a href=\"https://www.canonical.com/\">Canonical</a><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">, the company behind <a href=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a>,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"> is happy to announce that <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/uk/\">Spotify</a>, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">the world’s leading music streaming service, is now available as a snap, the universal Linux app packaging format. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">By launching as a snap, it enables users to enjoy Spotify natively on all Linux distributions that support snaps including Linux Mint, Manjaro, Debian, OpenSUSE, Solus as well as Ubuntu. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">“In launching their own snap, Spotify has ensured that their users in the Linux ecosystem are now able to enjoy the latest version of their leading music streaming application as soon as it’s released regardless of which distribution they are using,” said Jamie Bennett, VP of Engineering, Devices &amp; IoT at Canonical. “We’re glad to welcome Spotify to the snaps ecosystem and look forward to unveiling more leading snaps in 2018.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"><a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/\">Snaps</a> are containerised software packages designed to work perfectly and securely in any Linux environment.

Some teams tried them out, but nobody was entirely satisfied with it. Too many problems arose during development; bad or non-existing accessibility, no support for crawlers and bots, changing APIs and expensive refactorings. Even the simple task of displaying a menu on the frontend was problematic.</p> <p>All these concerns retained us at Amazee Labs from actually trying it. We avoided the use of decoupled systems. That is until a couple of months ago. In summer 2016, we were able to connect React with Drupal via GraphQL for the first time, and felt comfortable using it in a project. To increase the stakes we applied it in a multiple hundred-thousand dollar projects. We wouldn't be Amazee if we didn't! </p> <p>What came out is a completely decoupled system built on React that powers 12 individual websites with a single Drupal Backend connected through GraphQL. All of it is completely tested as part of a continuous deployment workflow, is hosted on Docker, has server-side rendering, and not a single line of content or menu on the frontend.</p> </blockquote> <p>As one of the leading Drupal and React agencies, we always look towards the future. We would like to take the opportunity to plan community activities for 2018 and beyond. Here is a list of topics we are looking to address:</p> <p>- Define overall goals for Drupal in Switzerland 2018<br /> - Fix dates &amp; contents for meetups for the Zurich Drupal Community<br /> - Pre-discuss planning for the next Drupal Mountain Camp</p> <p>Come for great talks, people and networking.

That's call-in orders, customer service, catalog orders, integrations with other fulfillment partners like Amazon or eBay—those are all channels through which you sell products.</p> <p>Omnichannel is about having all those channels work together. So if Joe buys something online, for instance, he should be able to return it to the physical store, and the customer service rep in the store should be able to see his updated account history, because everything should sync up.</p> <p>In the early days, basic omnichannel really just meant that if the product showed on the website, it was also in the store. But these days, omnichannel is also about customizing the experience for each channel.</p> <p>So if Joe is on the app, it should automatically pick his closest store. It should show him what aisle or section the item is located in and whether its in stock. On the other hand, if Joe is buying online, he doesn't care what aisle it's in, he just wants to know how long it will take to get the item shipped to him. So you have to tailor the experience to each type of channel, but the systems all need to mesh together.</p> <h2>What can you expect from the omnichannel experience from most platforms?</h2> <p>You will generally get rudimentary stock syncing. That means that whether you sell items online or in store, you will know how many you have and when you're out of stock. But even that has variations. Do you know your inventory status in real time? Every hour? Or does it only sync nightly? That can make a big difference.</p> <p>With most platforms, you're not going to get features like the ability to inform the customer where the item is located in the store. Only a few retailers do that because it's very difficult and requires a lot of extra work. You need to know that data, for one thing. So even if the platform supports that, that doesn't mean that you actually track the precise location of every single product in your store.</p> <h2>What's different with Drupal?</h2> <p>With Drupal, syncing is simple because we can use the same platform for everything: we have a point of sale, we have a web platform, and we can automatically do pushes to different channels like Amazon and eBay. We have real-time stock and shipping.</p> <p>Then we can add more customizations. We can allow for your customers to start an order online and finish it in store, for instance. Or if they go into the store and find it's not in stock, the clerk can put in an order—but instead of it getting shipped to the store and the customer having to come and pick it up, the clerk can simply turn it into an online order and have the item shipped to the customer. This is the kind of stuff we can mostly do out of the box, but there's usually a bit of customization work to make it a smooth flow.</p> <h2>What's the deal with add-ons?</h2> <p>Drupal is well set up for omnichannel, but keep in mind that there can be problems any time you integrate with other systems. Payment gateways are usually not a problem, but you can run into issues if you have to pass data to some warehouse fulfillment system and it can't provide real-time stock info back. So Drupal can keep track of stock, but if they knock over a pallet in the warehouse, or they get a new shipment but take a while to put it in, that can be slow to update.

One of the most important ways that we advance our mission is through DrupalCon, Drupal’s flagship event.</p> <p>At DrupalCon, community members with a technical, business, and marketing background come together to unite as a community, level up their Drupal skills, and contribute to the project. As a global event, DrupalCon breaks down walls between countries and the various personas who build, use and support Drupal, making it an accelerator of knowledge sharing, relationship building and contribution.</p> <p>DrupalCon is ready to grow. We need a model that allows the community to deliver DrupalCon globally. Our vision is to empower all regions to host DrupalCon, providing this experience to communities around the world. <strong>As a first step, we are licensing DrupalCon to the European region.</strong></p> <p>We are excited to empower a new entity grounded in the European Drupal community to take this special event to the next level. The DrupalCon license initiative is an opportunity to re-imagine DrupalCon Europe to uniquely serve the Drupal community. The license is designed to allow for a new creative direction while enhancing Drupal’s mission, vision and values while maintaining the integrity of DrupalCon.</p> <p>With the help of the DrupalCon Europe License Committee, we created a process for entities to apply for a DrupalCon Europe license by 30 March, 2018. We reviewed approaches used by other conference organizers, with particular attention to the key attributes that allow TED to scale its TEDx events. Then, we applied those learnings to our licensing process.</p> <p>In short, we learned that TEDx scales because of clear “rules and tools” for the licensee (aka event organizer) and we aimed to provide the same level of guidance and support for the DrupalCon licensee. There are clear guidelines in the license agreement and the event rules and we will provide support in the form of knowledge transfer, tools, and advisory services. We also recognize that this is our first time creating such a program, so we encourage entities who are applying to contact us to discuss any areas of concern or question.</p> <p>Below details how to submit a proposal for the DrupalCon license and the criteria that the Drupal Association will use to select the licensee.</p> <p>We are grateful for the help of Bert Boerland, Baddy Breidert, Alex Burrows, Gabor Hojtsy, Janne Kalliola, Zsofi Major, and Stella Powers, who participated in the DrupalCon Europe License committee and contributed many hours and great insight into this process.</p> <h3>Table of Contents</h3> <ul><li>Key Points</li> <li>Who Can Apply For a DrupalCon License</li> <li>Important Dates</li> <li>What To Submit To Apply for a DrupalCon License</li> <li>DrupalCon License Rules</li> <li>Drupal Association Support</li> <li>Decision Making Criteria</li> </ul><h3>Key Points</h3> <ul><li> <p>All proposals must adhere to the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/DrupalCon%20License%20Rules%20Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon Rules</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/DrupalCon%20License%20Agreement%20%28FORM%29%20%281%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">license agreement</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Apply by 30 March, 2018 by submitting your application to <a href=\"mailto:DrupalConEurope@association.drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalConEurope@association.drupal.org</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Send questions to: <a href=\"mailto:DrupalConEurope@association.drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalConEurope@association.drupal.org</a></p> </li> </ul><h3>Who Can Apply For a DrupalCon License</h3> <p>To be eligible to apply for a DrupalCon license, you must meet the following criteria:</p> <ul><li> <p>An entity grounded in the voice and needs of the Drupal community.

Your application must include the items listed below in the following formats (presentation, spreadsheet, document).</p> <ol><li> <p>DrupalCon Business Plan. Submit a business plan with the following information:</p> <ul><li> <p>Event location and dates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Detailed event budget, structured as similarly as possible to the current <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/DC%20DUB%20%26%20BAL%20Ticket%20Sale%20Breakdown%20-%20P%26L%20comparison.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon budget format</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Budget assumptions. Clearly define the budget assumptions for expenses. Also, include forecasted ticket and sponsor revenue. Define your ticket pricing plan and your sponsor strategy (who you will sell to and how you will create value for sponsors). Additionally, explain how you will secure the cash flow for initial event investments like securing the venue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Details about your event team. Who are the key people on your team, what roles will they play, and what is their event experience?</p> </li> <li> <p>An overview of how you will ensure the event reflects the Drupal community's needs and culture and moves the project forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>The event’s mission and vision, which should align with the Drupal Association’s <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/mission\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission and vision</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Target audience and target size. Which personas will your event attract and generally in what ratio? Please define your personas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event goals, strategies and objectives</p> </li> <li> <p>What value will you bring to each persona and how?</p> </li> <li> <p>Programming concept overview (which we know can change as you get further into planning). Please be sure to adhere to the programming rules.</p> <ul><li> <p>Event duration</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide a sample program and suggested tracks</p> </li> <li> <p>Share your general concept for session selection</p> </li> <li> <p>What is your plan to ensure conference diversity (attendees and speakers)</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell us about some aspirational keynotes you would like to invite</p> </li> </ul></li> </ul></li> <li> <p>Drupal culture. Tell us how you define Drupal’s community spirit and culture and what it means to you.</p> </li> <li> <p>What’s your “why”. Tell us why you want to organize DrupalCon. Why should you be selected, and how will you maintain the Drupal community spirit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your needs.

That means you can decide what is the best programming to meet the attendee’s needs. Or you can decide that sustainability is best achieved by starting with a smaller event that grows over time. However, all proposals and the actual event must conform to the DrupalCon licensing rules and agreement to maintain the Drupal Association’s community and governance expectations, as well as DrupalCon’s brand experience.</p> <p><strong><em>You can find <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/DrupalCon%20License%20Rules%20Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon Rules here.</a> </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>You can find the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/files/DrupalCon%20License%20Agreement%20%28FORM%29%20%281%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon license agreement here</a>.</em></strong></p> <p>Since this is the first time the Drupal Association has crafted DrupalCon license rules, we are open to discussion. Please contact us if you feel a rule is a blocker to you submitting a proposal. If discussions result in a rule change, we will update the rules document to reflect that change.</p> <h3>Drupal Association Support</h3> <p>The Drupal Association wants to make sure the chosen event organizer is set up for success. We recognize this means that we will play a role leading up to and perhaps during the event. Here are some ways the Drupal Association will help. We are open to hearing about additional ways in which we might help.</p> <ul><li> <p>In-person workshop: The Drupal Association staff will fly to the organizer’s location to run a workshop where we will do a knowledge transfer, training, and determine how the Drupal Association will play a support role during the event production phase.</p> </li> <li> <p>Playbooks, Guidelines, and Templates. The Drupal Association has several production playbooks that we will share so the organizer can see how the event was produced in the past. We recognize that the event organizer may want to alter our approach or create a brand new one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Advisory Services. You may have questions along the way and we are here to help. No question will be too big or too small. We can set up periodic check in meetings to provide guidance as you develop your event.</p> </li> <li> <p>Access to tools. DrupalCon promotion and management relies on several tools that we will share with the event organizer including the DrupalCon event site, social media handles, access to DrupalCon email lists, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Promotion Support</p> <ul><li> <p>The Drupal Association can amplify your call for ticket sales, sponsorship, and content through our channels including social media, email, newsletters.</p> </li> </ul></li> </ul><h3>Decision Making Criteria</h3> <p>When reviewing and comparing proposals, The Drupal Association will select the event organizer by using the following criteria:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td> <p>Category</p> </td> <td> <p>Topic</p> </td> <td> <p>Weight</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Sustainability</p> </td> <td> <p>Conservative, realistic, complete budget plan with clear revenue and expense budget assumptions</p> </td> <td> <p>10</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Staffing plan</p> </td> <td> <p>Clearly defined leadership team description and a staffing plan for producing the event that is designed to avoid burnout</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Goals, strategies, objectives</p> </td> <td> <p>Clearly articulated goals, strategies, and objectives that move the project forward, serve multiple personas, and has achievable metrics.</p> </td> <td> <p>9</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Location</p> </td> <td> <p>Easy to reach by European community</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Event Dates</p> </td> <td> <p>Avoids major holidays (national, religious, etc) and aligns with Dries Buytaert’s availability</p> </td> <td> <p>10</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Target Audience</p> </td> <td> <p>Program serves multiple personas</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Programming</p> </td> <td> <p>Creative approach for serving all persona while meeting the licensing rules.</p> </td> <td> <p>9</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Session Selection</p> </td> <td> <p>Well thought out approach that adheres to the DrupalCon licensing rules.</p> </td> <td> <p>7</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</p> </td> <td> <p>Well thought out approach for growing speaker and attendee diversity to exceed the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17iNHnKrazEYLlHJBV-Gnra1XQhGfUvW_ukkIUc1ZjBA/edit?disco=AAAABiDL8r4&amp;ts=5a260a81\" rel=\"nofollow\">DrupalCon Vienna benchmark</a></p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Definition of spirit/ culture</p> </td> <td> <p>Strong understanding of the Drupal culture</p> </td> <td> <p>7</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Keynote examples</p> </td> <td> <p>Creative, inspiring keynote ideas that speak to all personas</p> </td> <td> <p>6</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>Event Planning Experience</p> </td> <td> <p>Clear demonstration of event experience on the team</p> </td> <td> <p>7</p> </td> </tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>","published":"2017-12-19T18:09:07.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/call-for-proposals-drupalcon-europe-license","feed":{"source":"https://www.drupal.org/planet/rss.xml","link":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","name":"Drupal.org aggregator"}},{"title":"Acquia Developer Center Blog: A Look Inside Decoupled Architecture: The Engage Digital Application","content":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><em>“The most compelling advantage of API-first Drupal is not the way it negates Drupal's presentation features, it's the way it enables the capabilities of the CMS to power multiple applications and devices.

Kallos used the Webform module to demonstrate how easy it easy it is to capture a digital signature. The most ironic thing about watching the mayor sign the online voter registration bill, which is driven by the concept of digital signatures, into law, was the fact that he used used multiple pens to sign the bill. My daughter Lili and I both received pens that the mayor used to sign the bill. Everyone, myself included, has Kallos to thank for making this bill and experience happen. I guess - and this is a good thing - we’ll have to find other uses for our pens.</p><p>Last month, Kallos did a presentation at the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/\">NYC Drupal Meetup</a> about how he used the Webform module to help get legislation passed to <a href=\"http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/11/15/city-council-looks-easing-online-voter-registration\">allow online voter registration</a> for New Yorkers.</p><p> </p><p>We all know that we can’t vote online yet, but I was surprised to realize that people can’t even register to vote online!

Well, Ubuntu is also for hobbyists (and kids!) who don&#8217;t want to shell out $1k to play with robots. Thus, this series was born: one that doesn&#8217;t assume any ROS knowledge, and uses hardware that&#8217;s so inexpensive you could give it as a Christmas gift. I present you with a robot that costs less than $100: The <a href=\"https://thepihut.com/collections/camjam-edukit/products/camjam-edukit-3-robotics\">CamJam EduKit #3</a>, which is a wheeled robot kit you assemble and control with a Raspberry Pi. Let me break down the entire list of hardware you&#8217;ll need to follow this series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The EduKit, £18, so, say, $25</li>\n<li>A Raspberry Pi (I&#8217;m using a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/\">Raspberry Pi 2</a>, you need either the 2 or 3), $35</li>\n<li>Battery for Raspberry Pi (I used <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MWV1TJ6/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">this one</a>), $15\n<ul>\n<li>This is optional, but if you don&#8217;t have one your Pi will be tethered by its power supply.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-gaming/products/raspberry-pi-compatible-wireless-gamepad-controller?variant=38135423121\">Wireless controller</a>, £14, so, say, $20</li>\n<li>Total, including optional components: $95</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my previous robotics series, one of the reasons the Turtlebot was so expensive is because it has a plethora of software already written for it, like ROS drivers to control its movement, read from its sensors, etc. This little robot is different: we&#8217;ll need to write everything ourselves. Thankfully, the CamJam folks provide a <a href=\"http://camjam.me/?page_id=1035\">number of worksheets</a> meant to introduce you to the platform and get you started writing software to control the wheels, read from the ultrasonic sensor, and so on. We can leverage those to get up and running quickly, so throughout this series we&#8217;ll cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your first robot: Introduction to the Robot Operating System [2/5]\n<ul>\n<li>What is the Robot Operating System (ROS)? Why is it worth learning? How do I use it?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your first robot: The controller [3/5]\n<ul>\n<li>Getting data out of the wireless controller and into ROS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your first robot: The driver [4/5]\n<ul>\n<li>Learn a little control theory, write the driver for the robot.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your first robot: Sharing with others [5/5]\n<ul>\n<li>How do you start the system without needing to SSH in? How do you share your final product with your friends?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I mentioned, the CamJam worksheets will get us a long way toward what we need to learn for this series. However, rather than use Raspbian, we&#8217;re going to use Ubuntu Core. The worksheets are still perfectly applicable, and I&#8217;ll prove it by walking you through getting Ubuntu Core setup on your Raspberry Pi, and then we&#8217;ll go through one of the CamJam worksheets. Note that this is also a video series, feel free to watch the video version of this post:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KidVVqbsIHI\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>While this is meant to be an introduction, I want to be clear on some of the assumptions I&#8217;m making. This series assumes you&#8217;re at least somewhat familiar with Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distro, like Raspbian), particularly using the command-line. I don&#8217;t expect you to be a shell-scripting pro, but you should know how to navigate around the file system and use terminal-based editors (vi, nano, etc.)</p>\n<h2>What is Ubuntu Core</h2>\n<p>Ubuntu Core is a specialized distribution of Ubuntu that is dedicated to devices that fit into the &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; (IoT) bucket. This includes routers, thermostats, and of course, robots. It&#8217;s my hope that, in introducing you to the operating system (and tools like ROS) that the pros use for their robots, the road is paved for you to go on and accomplish great things in this field!</p>\n<p>Ubuntu Core is a bit different from Raspbian. It&#8217;s even a bit different than classic Ubuntu (or Ubuntu MATE)! Let&#8217;s get started installing it, and I&#8217;ll explain what I mean.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Install Ubuntu Core</h2>\n<p>This is already well-documented, but I want to add a few notes here before you follow the steps. First of all, a keyboard and monitor are required, but only for the first boot. Unlike Raspbian or Ubuntu MATE, there is no default username/password or install process where you create a user. It doesn&#8217;t even use a mouse&#8211; this is more like Ubuntu Server. In fact, by default there&#8217;s no local login at all: it&#8217;s all done over SSH (a remote login over the network), with cryptographic keys instead of passwords. This is part of Ubuntu Core&#8217;s &#8220;secure by default&#8221; philosophy. There are numerous examples of default credentials being abused (see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)\">Mirai botnet</a>), and as an IoT-focused operating system, Ubuntu Core can&#8217;t have that! That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll see an Ubuntu SSO account and SSH keys as prerequisites in the install guide (don&#8217;t worry, both are easy, and your robot will be super safe!).</p>\n<p>Alright, go ahead and follow the <a href=\"https://developer.ubuntu.com/core/get-started/raspberry-pi-2-3\">Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 install guide</a> (comment here if you have any questions). At the end of this step, you should have Ubuntu Core installed, and you should be able to SSH into the Pi.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Prepare developer setup</h2>\n<p>As an IoT-focused operating system, Ubuntu Core uses a different packaging format from Raspbian and classic Ubuntu. Rather than using Debian packaging (which involves familiar tools like <strong>apt</strong>), Ubuntu Core uses a packaging format called <strong>snaps</strong>. Snaps are far more robust when it comes to reliable updates and security, both of which are important to IoT devices, including robots. There is no <strong>apt</strong> on this system. To give you a taste of what using the <strong>snap</strong> command is like, ensure your system is completely up-to-date by running <strong>snap refresh</strong>.</p>\n<p>So how does one install all the developer tools to which one is accustomed? There&#8217;s a special snap for that called <strong>classic</strong>, which gives you access to all your familiar tools (including <strong>apt</strong>).</p>\n<p>Install the <strong>classic</strong> snap by following the &#8220;developing on target&#8221; section of the <a href=\"https://developer.ubuntu.com/core/get-started/developer-setup\">Developer setup guide</a> (again, comment here if you have any questions). At the end of this step, you should be able to run <strong>sudo classic</strong> and gain access to a shell where you can install debs, which we&#8217;ll use for hacking on our robot! Later we&#8217;ll walk through creating your own snap to control the robot, which makes sharing your project with your friends super easy.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: CamJam time</h2>\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;re now to the point where we can begin following CamJam&#8217;s worksheets! Why don&#8217;t we start with the <a href=\"https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3/raw/master/CamJam%20EduKit%203%20-%20Robotics%20Worksheet%201%20-%20Introduction.pdf\">very first one</a>. This one really assumes you&#8217;re running Raspbian, which we&#8217;re not, so while you can read the whole thing, we&#8217;re going to skip straight to the &#8220;Identifying your Version of Raspbian&#8221; step. No, we&#8217;re still not using Raspbian, but this section makes an interesting point that I want to make sure you notice:</p>\n<p>Ubuntu Core, like Debian Wheezy, considers GPIO access via memory mapping to be a privileged operation. As a result, any of the code throughout these worksheets that uses GPIO will need to be run with <strong>sudo.</strong></p>\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get started. Make sure you&#8217;re in your classic shell by running <strong>sudo classic</strong>. vi is available here by default, but you can <strong>sudo apt install nano</strong> if you want. Following the worksheet, open up <strong>1-helloworld.py</strong> and fill it with the following:</p>\n<pre># Print Hello World!\r\nprint('Hello World!')\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then save and exit. You can now run the code in that file with this command:</p>\n<pre>$ python3 1-helloworld.py\r\nHello World!\r\n</pre>\n<p>Go ahead and read through the rest of the worksheet, it will be helpful to you later on.</p>\n<p>I hope this gets you off to a good start using Ubuntu Core to hack on your Raspberry Pi projects. As homework for the rest of the series, also complete worksheets 2-4, and 7. You can totally do the other worksheets as well, but we won&#8217;t be using the ultrasonic sensor or line detector in this series, so you don&#8217;t have to. Before you do any other worksheets, though, you need to get the RPi.GPIO package installed. While in your classic shell, run:</p>\n<pre>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools\r\n$ pip3 install RPi.GPIO\r\n</pre>\n<p>Also, remember that you&#8217;ll need to use <strong>sudo</strong> for any python scripts that utilize GPIO. The next post in this series will be an introduction to ROS, what it is, why it&#8217;s useful, why you need to know it, and how to get it on your Ubuntu-Core-powered Raspberry Pi.</p>\n","published":"2017-12-19T14:04:50.000Z","author":"Kyle Fazzari","link":"https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/12/19/your-first-robot-a-beginners-guide-to-ros-and-ubuntu-core-1-5/","feed":{"source":"https://insights.ubuntu.com/feed/","link":"https://insights.ubuntu.com","name":"Ubuntu Insights"}},{"title":"JetBrains adopts snaps to further simplify developers’ lives","content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Used by companies as diverse as NASA, Pinterest, and CitiBank, <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains</a> takes the repetition out of a developer’s life through their range of developer tools which automate routine checks and corrections.

We deliver intelligent software solutions that make developers more productive by simplifying their challenging tasks, automating the routine, and helping them adopt the best development practices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">At JetBrains we have a number of tools for different programming languages and technologies: a set of IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, and PyCharm; .NET development tools: ReSharper, Rider, dotMemory, etc.; team development tools: TeamCity (CI solution), YouTrack (bug tracker), and Upsource (code review tool); and Kotlin, a JVM-based language originally developed at JetBrains. All our IDEs are cross-platform, and Linux users comprise a large part of our user base, which is why we’ve been looking to improve the installation and update experience for Linux users. Recently we adapted snap packages for almost all of our IDEs and published them in the snap store. Snaps for the rest of our IDEs are on their way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">We’re still evaluating how well snaps work for our users. Right now we’re promoting snaps as a suggested installation and update mechanism only for PyCharm (our Python IDE), while looking into how people use snaps for other products not being promoted.</span></p>\n<h2>What was the appeal of snaps that made you decide to invest in them?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">There has always been a need for an automatic and convenient way to manage installations of our IDEs. We do 3 major releases per year for each of our IDEs, we release minor bug-fix updates quite often, and we run Early Access Programs for each of the IDEs in which we release a number of alpha and beta builds prior to the next official stable release. This way, our active users can put their hands on coming features and bugfixes earlier in the release cycle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Many users have several IDEs installed on their machines, which means keeping track of updates can become a mess quickly. Many weren’t happy with plain tar.gz archives, so we decided to invest in a more standardised way of distributing our software. Snap packages seemed exactly what we need, and we’re happy that now our Ubuntu users can easily install an IDE from a desired channel and forget about updating the builds as the updates come in the background automatically.</span></p>\n<h2>How does building snaps compare to other forms of packaging you produce? How easy was it to integrate with your existing infrastructure and process?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">It took some time to integrate snaps into our existing build processes. However, once we implemented <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/\">building snap packages</a> automatically on TeamCity (our CI server) for one of the IDEs, it wasn’t that hard to adopt the same process for other tools we have at JetBrains.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-82377\" src=\"https://insights.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/b277/JB-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3838\" height=\"2101\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image: PyCharm Professional</em></p>\n<h2>Do you currently use the snap store as a way of distributing your software?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The Snap store provides additional exposure to our tools for many of our existing and potential users. The decision to use it came quite naturally. We believe the store will be a major software discovery tool on Linux, so the more people find out about our tools naturally and install them more easily, the better for everybody.</span></p>\n<h2>If so, how do you see the store changing the way users find and install your software?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Searching for software on the snap store and in the Ubuntu software centre are the standard ways for many Linux users to discover and install software on their systems. Previously, our users could get installation artefacts only from our website. With snap packages, the new method is now recommended on our website and people can also discover our products organically in the snap store. The installation process with snaps is easy and straightforward, reaching a wider audience, which benefits us as developers and our users in many ways.</span></p>\n<h2>What are your expectations or already seen savings by using snaps instead of having to package for other distros?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Since implementing snap packages for our tools, we’ve been seeing continuous growth in their usage. So far we haven’t got any major complaints, which we think means people do like using snaps. We expect more and more people will use snaps in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The only missing thing when shipping our tools with snap packages is that we require the “classic” confinement policy to make our tools work properly on Linux. This mode is available only on Ubuntu, but we’d like to expand snaps as a recommended installation method for other popular Linux distributions. We hope that the “classic” policy will become available for other distributions at some point.</span></p>\n<h2>What release channels (edge/beta/candidate/stable) in the store are you using or plan to use, if any?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">During our release cycle we ship Early Access Preview, Public Preview, Release Candidate, and finally release builds, so our process matches snap channels pretty well. We put all Early Access builds into the edge channel, Public Previews into the beta channel, etc. We find snap channels are very flexible and satisfy all our needs.</span></p>\n<h2>How do you think packaging your software as a snap helps your users? Did you get any feedback from them?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">The main advantage of using snap packages for our users is that they don’t have to care about updates, whether they’re participating in our Early Access Program or using officially released builds only. They just install tools from desired channels and the update process happens in the background, so they always stay on the latest version available.</span></p>\n","published":"2017-12-19T12:24:10.000Z","author":"Sarah Dickinson","link":"https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/12/19/jetbrains-adopts-snaps-to-further-simplify-developers-lives/","feed":{"source":"https://insights.ubuntu.com/feed/","link":"https://insights.ubuntu.com","name":"Ubuntu Insights"}},{"title":"Droptica: Droptica: Building a big website? Here are ten reasons why you should be using Drupal","content":"When you’re building an advanced website, you can choose from among many technologies. Usually, the first choice is the programming language (PHP, Python, Java, ASP.NET, etc.) and then we decide whether we should code everything from scratch or use a framework to do all the heavy lifting. There is also a third choice, a more comprehensive solution –so-called CMF systems, which stands for content management framework. Drupal 8 is one of these systems. In this article, I will tell you why it’s worth it to choose Drupal as the basis for any large and advanced website. By large and advanced, I mean one that is changed frequently. Content changes are carried out by at least one editor, supported by at least one developer (along with a QA tester and a sysadmin), who’s responsible for continuous development of the website, adding new functionalities, fixing the emerging bugs and so on.

This is followed by 6.7% that chose to meet clients “each day for the daily standup”, and the same amount chose to meet clients “never”. It looks like there is no apparent tendency but half of the teams choose to work together with clients more regularly, and another half of the team doesn’t have much client interactions.</p> <p><img alt=\"Agile How regularly does the team meet the client\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1e95a280-92af-4144-b200-0e4dfbaa4587\" src=\"https://www.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/agile_team_meets_client.png\" /></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">For us, at Amazee this depends heavily on the project and the teams. In some cases we form teams together with clients where all developers will be assigned to the project full time in that consequence have regular client interactions. For the stable Scrum teams in Zurich that I work most with, we run multiple projects at the same time and therefore didn’t consider inviting clients to our daily meetings as we discuss several projects at the same time. As we have been successfully moving towards having fewer projects per team and a global maintenance team, we are considering this option though as to have closer client interactions between the team members. On top of that, we have found regular demos for clients and grooming meetings between the teams and clients beneficial.

The lowest indicates communication is handled “exclusively by a person dedicated to talking to the client (PM, PO proxy, ...)”, and the highest, indicates that communication is handled “Always together with the entire team”. An equal share of 33% turned out to be with<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 246, 245);\"> a 2 or a 3, </span><span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 246, 245);\">13.3% with a 1 or a 4 and 6.7% with a 5. </span>We can see that there is a tendency to channel communication between clients and the team through a person within the company (PM, PO proxy).</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Agile how is communication between the team and the client handled\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"02404880-0ca9-49c8-b200-f3852dee6694\" src=\"https://www.amazeelabs.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/agile_communication_team_client.png\" /></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">For us at Amazee its a 2. Every project has a PO from our side assigned that will represent the client to the team if the client is not available and will represent the team to the client to have a single point of contact. Still, we encourage clients to meet the team regularly for a better understanding on both sides of the project and collaboration. The higher the ratio is that a team can dedicate their time to one project &amp; customer, the easier it is to justify that the entire team will collaborate with the client. Being in an agency environment with multiple projects at the same time, those customers are not often to be encountered though. This is why we try to find a good compromise between customer collaboration with the team and efficiency gains of channelled communication.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">How do you and your team interact with your clients?

As Wikimedians, their backgrounds vary widely:  they are editors, reviewers, content translators, leaders of local chapters, software writers, off-wiki event organizers, workshop facilitators, sysops and bureaucrats, copyright and licensing permission experts, policy advisors, and more. Many members also serve as advisors to new grantees, helping to answer questions, connect them to relevant resources, and comment on monthly and midpoint reports. These volunteers play a critical role throughout the process, including making decisions about how to best use the movement’s money to achieve impact.</p>\n<p>In this latest round, 26 eligible proposals were submitted for the committee’s review.

equity</em>, this round of Project Grants saw many proposals seeking to “focus our efforts on the knowledge and communities that have been left out by structures of power and privilege.”   Three projects focus on creating better concrete tools to correct for inequity.  The <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Nigerian_keyboard_project\">Nigerian keyboard project</a>, for instance, will empower Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo-speaking editors with one of the most basic and powerful tools an editor needs: a functioning keyboard. At the same time, <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Kiwix/User_Experience\">Kiwix/User Experience</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/WikiInAfrica/WikiFundi\">WikiInAfrica/Wikifundi</a> are taking strides to overcome the obstacles posed by limited or nonexistent internet access, making the Wikimedia projects more truly open and available for everyone.  Two projects focus on expanding our thinking, pushing the boundaries of our awareness of our own unconscious biases:  <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Chinmayisk/Community_toolkit_for_Greater_Diversity\">Community toolkit for greater diversity</a> will take a bold step toward educating Wikimedians about what is required to truly welcome new editors from demographics that are often underrepresented in our volunteer communities.  The <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Wikipedia_Cultural_Diversity_Observatory_(WCDO)\">Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory (WCDO)</a> will invite editors to reflect on how our own language and cultural perspectives limit our ability to see the full breadth of the sum of human knowledge, and offer some initial steps for widening our horizons.  Two projects, <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Les_sans_pagEs\">Les sans pagEs</a> on the French Wikipedia and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Camelia.boban/WikiDonne_roadmap\">WikiDonne roadmap</a> on the Italian Wikipedia, will continue to organize Wikimedians to correct for gender bias, empowering female-identified editors to bring their voices to our projects, and inviting all editors to participate in expanding the gender diversity of encyclopedic content.</p>\n<p>Much more is needed if we are to realize the ambitious vision that movement direction has set for us in regard to Knowledge equity, and we invite future applicants to continue to dream and scheme about how we can get there.</p>\n<p><em>Research</em></p>\n<p>This round brought needed attention to a seeming bias within Project Grants.  Though this grant program includes four themes, research is often entirely excluded.  Several Wikimedians spoke up about the missed opportunity it means for the movement when we pass over research proposals from skilled thinkers offering to address some of our most compelling problems.  Moving forward, we will be reviewing this trend and seeking ways to support balanced and informed decision-making around research proposals.</p>\n<h4>Committee recruitment</h4>\n<p>As we head into 2018, the current dedicated committee members will have completed two years of service with the Project Grants program.  We are incredibly grateful for their skillful and impactful work.  As some committee members prepare to step down, we are seeking new members to relieve them.  As always, we hope to diversify the committee as much as possible with multiple perspectives and skillsets.  Anyone is invited to submit your name as a candidate.  Our <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Quarterly/Committee#committee-criteria\">membership criteria</a> is available on Meta, as is the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Committee/Candidates\">prospective candidates page</a> where you are welcome to add your name by January 15 if you would like to join us. Or you can reach out to the Community Resources team to learn more about this opportunity.</p>\n<p>In particular, we welcome reviewers who are qualified to help us to develop a stronger process for evaluating research proposals.</p>\n<p>If you or someone you know might be interested in contributing as a committee member, you are welcome to contact me with questions or recommendations at <a href=\"mailto:projectgrants@wikimedia.org\">projectgrants@wikimedia.org</a>.  Please put “committee candidacy” in the subject line of your email.</p>\n<h4>Coming up in 2018</h4>\n<p>The open call for <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project\">2018&#8217;s first round of Project Grants</a> will launch on 1 January 2018, with applications due on 31 January.  Return submissions are welcome, though we ask that you take care to review any feedback submitted by the committee and revise your proposal accordingly first.  Office hours for proposal consultation will be posted on the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project\">Project Grants Start page</a> by 1 January.</p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Inspire\">Inspire Campaign</a> focused on bringing in new readers—especially in countries where Wikimedia projects are not well known—will begin in January 2018. During this month-long campaign, contributors can submit and review ideas for projects, seek collaborators, move those ideas into grant proposals, or otherwise get support from volunteers and staff to help develop their idea into implementation, such as a newsreel project.</p>\n<p>We look forward to reviewing your suggestions and future submissions, but for now we say congratulations to the successful grantees and encourage you to <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Browse_applications\">follow their progress</a> as they begin work in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><em>Marti Johnson, Program Officer, Individual Grants</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.wikimedia.org&#038;blog=67752302&#038;post=54480&#038;subd=wikimediablog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-18T21:48:39.000Z","author":"Marti Johnson","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/18/project-grants-awarded/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org","name":"Wikimedia Blog"}},{"title":"Grabación del taller de introducción a gvSIG realizado en la UMH de Elche","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-18T20:26:27.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/18/grabacion-del-taller-de-introduccion-a-gvsig-realizado-en-la-umh-de-elche/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Xeno Media: Web Accessibility Part I: Do we still need to ask?","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\"> “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Tim Berners-Lee, 1997</p> What exactly is web accessibility? <p dir=\"ltr\">Web accessibility is the removal of technical impediments that could limit access to or interaction with a website by any person with disabilities. The goal of a web accessible site is to allow all users equal access to all content and functionality. </p> Some disabilities that web accessibility can address <ul><li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">Visual: Visual impairments up to and including complete blindness, various common types of poor vision, color blindness</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">Motor Skills: Difficulty using hands, tremors, Bradykinesia, loss of detailed muscle control, etc., due to conditions such as Parkinson’s, MS, stroke, and other movement disorders</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">Auditory: Hearing impairments up to and including total deafness and including the hard of hearing</p> </li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">Cognitive: Cognitive impairment and learning disabilities (Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, etc.) that may affect memory, attention, problem-solving and logic skills.</p> </li> </ul>Temporary Disabilities <p dir=\"ltr\">When developing with accessibility in mind there will almost certainly be some unexpected good fortune. For example: if a person breaks her primary hand, and is forced to wear a cast, she may temporarily lose the ability to operate a mouse. The developer didn’t plan to cater to the temporarily disabled, but well designed keyboard navigation could surely save the day for such an accident victim.</p> Why does web accessibility matter? <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">It’s the right thing to do.</p> <p> Here’s a chance to make a positive difference in many people’s lives. Improving a site’s accessibility will make that site better for all users and will likely improve its position in the SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). So be a good citizen and contribute to web accessibility! Make the web a better place for everyone!</p></li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">It may be required.</p> <p> There are various state and federal laws regarding web accessibility.</p> <p> Some organizations and businesses have faced legal action for non-compliance with accessibility guidelines. Even if you were to win such a challenge, the cost in legal fees and in lost time would be substantial. Why risk exposing your business to the possibility of a legal challenge.</p></li> <li dir=\"ltr\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">It’s good for business.</p> <p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2002 Survey of Income and Program Participation (<a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/busstat.htm\">SIPP</a>), there are 51.2 million people with disabilities in the United States. That’s 18.1% of the U.S. population! Those folks need goods and services too, some of which are very specialized.</p> <p> Millions of people with disabilities shop, travel, buy cars, buy homes, eat out, go out and participate in most of the same activities as their fully-abled friends, neighbors and family. Web developers are in a unique position to work towards the good of all to advocate for and to help facilitate these behaviors. We all benefit.<br /> </p></li> <li>Web accessibility is becoming easier to achieve and more unified with web standards as time passes.</li> More to come <p dir=\"ltr\">This series on Web accessibility will continue with the following:</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Part II: What guides accessibility efforts?</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">This post will highlight the laws and governance related to web accessibility efforts.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Part III: Tools and techniques for web accessibility</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Here we will provide a primer on assistive technologies and tools you and your developers can use to make your site more accessible.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Part IV: Case studies</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">This post will highlight two real-world applications where we have worked closely with clients to achieve highly-accessible websites. </p> <p> </p>","published":"2017-12-18T20:06:09.000Z","author":"","link":"https://www.xenomedia.com/blog/web-accessibility-part-i-do-we-still-need-ask?utm_source=feed&amp%3Butm_medium=drupal-planet&amp%3Butm_campaign=node-135_","feed":{"source":"https://www.drupal.org/planet/rss.xml","link":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","name":"Drupal.org aggregator"}},{"title":"LXD Weekly Status #28","content":"<p><img src=\"https://insights.ubuntu.com/wp-content/uploads/ea42/LXD-Template28.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-82347\" /></p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>This is our last status update before we break for the holidays.</p>\n<p>On the LXD side of things, this past week saw the inclusion of a couple of minor features (<code>--all</code> flag and <code>boot.stop.priority</code> option) and quite a few bugfixes.</p>\n<p>In low level LXC, a lot of changes have been going on to improve handling of application containers, including namespace sharing, improved hook handling, improved CRIU integration and new configuration keys to configure container sysctl keys and the out of memory killer.</p>\n<p>LXD 2.21 is schedule to be tagged tomorrow and we expect it to roll-out to most users before the end of year.

href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/08/23/wikidata-glam/\">through Wikidata</a>. Since then, the Wikidata community working on heritage materials has grown significantly—and the recent <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikidataCon_2017\">Wikidata Conference</a> highlighted just how powerful and cross-disciplinary Wikidata is becoming, allowing for a number of different audiences to learn more about their data.</p>\n<p>In the last couple months, I put together an exploration of different practices that GLAM’s are using enrich their collection systems, which store records about the objects in their collections. These technical innovations help make institutional collections rich, more dynamic and better connected with not only Wikimedia content but collections and research throughout the world. With Wikidata, collections and catalogues become more valuable than their original intention of the catalogers and collectors who described them, making heritage much easier to find and share. Quite simply: connecting collections with Wikidata makes them more useful for everyone!</p>\n<p><strong>Read the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alexstinson/wikidata-in-collections-building-a-universal-language-for-connecting-glam-catalogs-59b14aa3214c\">full length exploration on Medium</a>.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Alex Stinson, Strategist, Community Engagement</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.wikimedia.org&#038;blog=67752302&#038;post=54474&#038;subd=wikimediablog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-18T19:29:40.000Z","author":"Alex Stinson","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/18/wikipedia-wikidata-collection-catalogues/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org","name":"Wikimedia Blog"}},{"title":"Evolving Web: Writing a Custom Migration Source Plugin in Drupal 8","content":"<a href=\"https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/writing-custom-migration-source-plugin-drupal-8?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=feed_image\"> <img src=\"https://evolvingweb.ca/sites/default/files/styles/ewsite8_blog_image/public/2017-12/iStock-92323519-compressed.jpg?itok=iKw4mSD-\" width=\"720\" height=\"358\" alt=\"Developing photos\" typeof=\"Image\" class=\"img-responsive\" /></a><p>Usually, Drupal migrations get run at the beginning of a project to get all your content into Drupal. But sometimes, you need to create a migration that runs on a regular basis. For example, you have an external database of courses and programs maintained by a university that needs to be displayed on a Drupal site. Another example: you have a database of book data that needs to be pulled into Drupal nightly.</p> <p>When working with migrations where the source files are updated every day, it can get really tedious to download the updated source files manually each time the migration runs.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll write a source plugin based on the CSV source plugin which will allow us to automatically download CSV files from a remote server via SFTP before running migrations. This article was co-authored by my colleague <a href=\"https://github.com/gnuget\">David Valdez</a> - <em>gracias</em> David for your contribution.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>In a project we worked on recently, we had the following situation:</p> <ul><li>CSV files are updated by a PowerShell script every night on the client's server.</li> <li>These CSV files are accessible via SFTP.</li> </ul><p>Our task is to download the CSV source files over SFTP and to use them as our migration source.</p> <h2>Before We Start</h2> <ul><li>This articles assumes that you can write custom modules. If you have never written a custom module, you can try reading this article on <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules\" rel=\"nofollow\">creating custom modules</a>.</li> <li>It is assumed that you have working knowledge of migrations in Drupal 8. If you are new to Drupal 8 migrations, I recommend you to start by reading these articles first: <ul><li><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/drupal-8-migration-migrating-basic-data-part-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal 8 Migration: Migrating Basic Data (Part 1)</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/drupal-8-migration-migrating-taxonomy-term-references-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal 8 Migration: Migrating Taxonomy Term References (Part 2)</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/drupal-8-migration-migrating-files-images-part-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal 8 Migration: Migrating Files / Images (Part 3)</a></li> </ul></li> </ul><h2>The Plan</h2> <p>The goal is to avoid downloading the file manually every time we run our migrations. So we need a way to doing this automatically everytime we execute a migration. To achieve this, we create a custom source plugin extending the CSV plugin provided by the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_source_csv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Migrate Source CSV</a> module, which will download CSV files from a remote server and pass it to the CSV plugin to process them.</p> <h2>The Source Migrate Plugin</h2> <p>To start, let's create a custom module and call it <code>migrate_example_source</code> and implement a custom migrate source plugin by creating a PHP class inside it at <code>/src/Plugin/migrate/source/MigrateExampleSourceRemoteCSV.php</code></p> <pre> We start implementing the class by simply extending the CSV plugin provided by the <code>migrate_source_csv</code> module:</pre><pre> <code class=\"language-php highlight\">namespace Drupal\\migrate_source_csv\\Plugin\\migrate\\source; use Drupal\\migrate_source_csv\\Plugin\\migrate\\source\\CSV as SourceCSV; use phpseclib\\Net\\SFTP /** * @MigrateSource( * id = \"migrate_example_source_remote_csv\" * ) */ class MigrateExampleSourceRemoteCSV extends SourceCSV {}</code></pre><p>Adding the annotation <code>@MigrateSource</code> is very important because that is what will make the <code>migrate</code> module detect our source plugin. In our plugin, we use the <a href=\"https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib\">phpseclib/phpseclib</a> libraries to make SFTP connections. Hence, we need to include the libraries in our project by running the following command in the Drupal root:</p> <pre> <code class=\"highlight\">composer require phpseclib/phpseclib</code></pre><p>Our plugin will download the source CSV file and will simply pass it to the CSV plugin to do the rest. We do the download when the plugin is being instantiated like this:</p> <pre> <code class=\"language-php highlight\">/** * {@inheritdoc} */ public function __construct(array $configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition, MigrationInterface $migration) { // If SFTP connection parameters are present. if (!empty($configuration['sftp'])) { // A settings key must be specified. // We use the settings key to get SFTP configuration from $settings. if (!isset($configuration['sftp']['settings'])) { throw new MigrateException('Parameter \"sftp/settings\" not defined for Remote CSV source plugin.'); } // Merge plugin settings with global settings. $configuration['sftp'] += Settings::get('sftp', []); // We simply download the remote CSV file to a temporary path and set // the temporary path to the parent CSV plugin. $configuration['path'] = $this->downloadFile($configuration['sftp']); } // Having downloaded the remote CSV, we simply pass the call to the parent plugin. parent::__construct($configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition, $migration); }</code></pre><p>In the constructor we are using global SFTP credentials with <code>Settings::get()</code>. We need to define the credentials in <code>settings.php</code> like this:</p> <pre> <code class=\"language-php highlight\">$settings['sftp'] = array( 'default' => [ 'server' => 'ftp.example.com', 'username' => 'username', 'password' => 'password', 'port' => '22', ], );</code></pre><p>Once we have the credentials of the FTP server we use a <code>downloadFile()</code> method to download the remote CSV file. Here's an extract of the relevant code:</p> <pre> <code class=\"language-php highlight\">protected function downloadFile(array $conn_config) { ... // Prepare to download file to a temporary directory. $path_remote = $conn_config['path']; $basename = basename($path_remote); $path_local = file_directory_temp() . '/' . $basename; ... // Download file by SFTP and place it in temporary directory. $sftp = static::getSFTPConnection($conn_config); if (!$sftp->get($path_remote, $path_local)) { throw new MigrateException('Cannot download remote file ' . $basename . ' by SFTP.'); } ... // Return path to the local of the file. // This will in turn be passed to the parent CSV plugin. return $path_local; }</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> The code block above has been simplified a bit. If you see the <a href=\"https://github.com/evolvingweb/migrate_example_source/blob/8.x/src/Plugin/migrate/source/MigrateExampleSourceRemoteCSV.php\">actual source plugin</a>, there are some lines of code which make things more compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/migrate-api/migrate-process-plugins/process-plugin-migration_lookup-formerly-migration\">migration_lookup</a> plugin.</p> <p>This method creates an SFTP connection, downloads the file to a temporary location and returns the path to the downloaded file. The temporary file path is then passed to the <code>Migrate Source CSV</code> and that's it! Finally, to use the plugin in our migration we just set our plugin as the <code>source/plugin</code>:</p> <pre> <code class=\"language-php highlight\">id: migrate_example_content label: 'Example content' ... source: plugin: migrate_example_source_remote_csv # Settings for our custom Remote CSV plugin. sftp: settings: sftp path: \"/path/to/file/example_content.csv\" # Settings for the contrib CSV plugin. header_row_count: 1 keys: - id ...</code></pre><p>The code for this plugin and the example module is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/evolvingweb/migrate_example_source\">migrate_example_source</a>.

The reasonining is that in my setup, forms are managed by site editors, not developers. (This is not related to migration per se, but was a success criteria for my migration so I’ll document my solution here)</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"migration-from-drupal-7\">Migration from Drupal 7</h2> <p>I could not find a reliable upgrade or migration path from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. I found <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_migrate\">webform_migrate</a> lacks documentation (I don’t know where to start) and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_webform\">migrate_webform</a> is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_webform/issues/2279477\">meant for Drupal 6, not Drupal 7 as a source</a>.</p> <p>I settled on a my own combination of tools and workflows to perform the migration, all of them available on my Github account.</p> <p>Using version 8.x-5.x of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webform\">webform</a>, I started by enabling <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">webform</code>, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">webform_node</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">webform_ui</code> on my Drupal 8 site, this gives me an empty webform node type.</p> <p>I then followed the instructions for a basic migration, which is outside the scope of this article. I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/dcycle/d6_to_d8_migration_example/tree/7\">project on Github</a>which I use as starting point from my Drpual 6 and 7 to 8 migrations. The blog post <a href=\"https://drupalize.me/blog/201604/custom-drupal-drupal-migrations-migrate-tools\">Custom Drupal-to-Drupal Migrations with Migrate Tools, Drupalize.me, April 26, 2016 by William Hetherington</a> provides more information on performing a basic migration of data.</p> <p>Once you have set up your migration configurations as per those instructions, you should be able to run:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush migrate-import upgrade_d7_node_webform --execute-dependencies </code></pre></div></div> <p>And you should see something like:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Processed 25 items (25 created, 0 updated, 0 failed, 0 ignored) - done with 'upgrade_d7_node_type' Processed 11 items (11 created, 0 updated, 0 failed, 0 ignored) - done with 'upgrade_d7_user_role' Processed 0 items (0 created, 0 updated, 0 failed, 0 ignored) - done with 'upgrade_d7_user_role' Processed 95 items (95 created, 0 updated, 0 failed, 0 ignored) - done with 'upgrade_d7_user' Processed 109 items (109 created, 0 updated, 0 failed, 0 ignored) - done with 'upgrade_d7_node_webform' </code></pre></div></div> <p>At this point I had all my webforms as nodes with the same node ids on Drupal 7 and Drupal 8, however this does nothing to import the actual forms or submissions.</p> <h2 id=\"importing-the-data-itself\">Importing the data itself</h2> <p>I found that the most efficient way of importing the data was to create my own Drupal 8 module, which <a href=\"https://github.com/dcycle/webform_d7_to_d8\">I have published on Dcycle’s Github account</a>, called <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">webform_d7_to_d8</code>. (I have decided against publishing this on Drupal.org because I don’t plan on maintaining it long-term, and I don’t have the resources to combine efforts with existing webform migration modules.)</p> <p>I did my best to make that module self-explanatory, so you should be able to follow the steps the <a href=\"https://github.com/dcycle/webform_d7_to_d8\">README file</a>, which I will summarize here:</p> <p>Start by giving your Drupal 8 site access to your Drupal 7 database:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$databases['upgrade']['default'] = array ( 'database' =&gt; 'drupal7database', 'username' =&gt; 'drupal7user', 'password' =&gt; 'drupal7password', 'prefix' =&gt; '', 'host' =&gt; 'drupal7host', 'port' =&gt; '3306', 'namespace' =&gt; 'Drupal\\\\Core\\\\Database\\\\Driver\\\\mysql', 'driver' =&gt; 'mysql', ); </code></pre></div></div> <p>Run the migration with our without options:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush ev 'webform_d7_to_d8()' </code></pre></div></div> <p>or</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush ev 'webform_d7_to_d8([\"nid\" =&gt; 123])' </code></pre></div></div> <p>or</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush ev 'webform_d7_to_d8([\"simulate\" =&gt; TRUE])' </code></pre></div></div> <p>…</p> <p>More detailed information can be found in the modlue’s <a href=\"https://github.com/dcycle/webform_d7_to_d8\">README file</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"treating-webforms-as-data\">Treating webforms as data</h2> <p>Once you have imported your webforms to Drupal 8, they are treated as configuration, that is, the Webform module assumes that developers, not site builders, will be creating the forms. This may be fine in many cases, however my usecase is that site editors want to create and edit forms directly on the production, and we don’t want them to be tracked by the configuration management system.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/jrockowitz\">Jacob Rockowitz</a> <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webform/issues/2931104\">pointed me in the right direction</a> for making sure webforms are not treated as configuration. For that purpose I am using <a href=\"https://github.com/previousnext/drush_cmi_tools\">Drush CMI tools</a> by Previous Next and documented on their blog post, <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/introducing-drush-cmi-tools\">Introducing Drush CMI tools, 24 Aug. 2016</a>.</p> <p>Once you install in your <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">~/.drush</code> folder and run <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cc drush</code>, you can use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">druch cexy</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">druch cimy</code> and instead of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cex</code> in your conguration management process. Here is how and why:</p> <p>Normally, if you develop your site locally and, say, add a content type or field, or remove a content type of field, you can run <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cex</code> to export your newly created configuration. Then, your colleagues can pull your code and run <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim</code> to pull your configuration. <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim</code> can also be used in continuous integration, preproduction, dev, and production environments.</p> <p>The problem is that <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cex</code> exports <em>all</em> configuration, and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim</code> deletes everything in the database which is not in configuration. In our case, we don’t want to consider webforms as configuration but as data, just as nodes as taxonomy terms: we don’t want them to be exported along with other configuration; and if they exist on a target environment we want to leave them as they are.</p> <p>Using Drush CMI tools, you can add a file such as the following to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">~/.drush/config-ignore.yml</code>:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># See http://blog.dcycle.com/blog/2017-12-18 ignore: - webform.webform.* </code></pre></div></div> <p>This has to be done on all developers’ machines or, if you use Docker, on a shared Docker container (which is outside the scope of this article).</p> <p>Now, for exporting configuration, run:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush cexy --destination='/path/to/config/folder' </code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, webforms will not be exported along with other configuration.</p> <p>We also need to avoid erasing webforms on target environments: if you create a webform on a target environment, then run <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim</code>, you will see something like:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>webform.webform.webform_9521 delete webform.webform.webform_8996 delete webform.webform.webform_8991 delete webform.webform.webform_8986 delete </code></pre></div></div> <p>So, we need to avoid deleting webforms on the target environment when we import configuration. We could just do <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim --partial</code> but this avoids deleting <em>everything</em>, not just webforms.</p> <p>Drush CMI tools provides an alternative:</p> <div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>drush cimy --source=/path/to/config/folder </code></pre></div></div> <p>This works much like <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">drush cim --partial</code>, but it allows you to specify another parameter, –delete-list=/path/to/config-delete.yml</p> <p>Then, in <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">config-delete.yml</code>, you can specify items that you actually want to delete on the target environment, for example content types, fields, and views which do not exist in code. This is dependent on your workflow and they way to set it up isdocumented on the <a href=\"https://github.com/previousnext/drush_cmi_tools\">Drush CMI tools project homepage</a>.</p> <p>With this in place, we’ll have our Drupal 7 webforms on our Drupal 8 site.</p> <p>I recently needed to port hundreds of Drupal 7 webforms with thousands of submissions from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.</p>","published":"2017-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","author":"","link":"http://blog.dcycle.com/blog/2017-12-18/migrating-webforms-drupal7-to-drupal8/","feed":{"source":"https://www.drupal.org/planet/rss.xml","link":"https://www.drupal.org/planet","name":"Drupal.org aggregator"}},{"title":"Sooper Drupal Themes: Try The SooperThemes Drupal 8 Experience With Our First Beta Release.

This means there's not just the work of migrating and testing hundreds of content items but also different interactions between Glazed Builder and several modules. We're aiming for an early January release but can't make a hard guarantee. However, since the beta releases will be backwards compatible you can already start building our Drupal 8 projects if you're with being a beta tester and you don't need the demos that are yet to be ported.&nbsp;</div> <div class=\"az-element az-text az-element--hide-controls\" data-az-id=\"1aeyptyt\" data-azb=\"az_text\" data-azcnt=\"true\" style=\"\"> <h3>Refinements and Minor Bug Fixes: Patch Release On D7 Products</h3> <p>We've been cleaning out out some minor bugs for Glazed Theme and Glazed Builder, trying to get the bug counter to zero before we release on Drupal 8.

The contest, now in its sixth year, focuses on &#8220;monuments,&#8221; which the organizers <a href=\"https://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/contest/\">broadly define</a> as structures recognized by a local authority as being of particular value to cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s rendition lived up to the billing: over 254,000 photos were submitted by <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikiloves/\">just over 10,000</a> photographers. A plurality of the photos were of Ukrainian subjects, followed by Armenian.</p>\n<p>The top images were winnowed down by the federated nature of the contest, as Wiki Loves Monuments is primarily organized on a national level by <a href=\"https://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/jury/\">people just like you</a>.

Still, that was no obstacle to Matthew Hoser, who used the rusting piers to frame the outermost ruins of what was a concert hall one century ago. &#8220;I think what makes my photo stand out is its simplicity,&#8221; Hoser said. &#8220;The long exposure &#8230; allowed me to smooth out the water and get a slightly smoky effect at the shore. This really allowed the strong lines of the derelict pier to stand out. I also like the contrasting textures of the pebbly sand and the soft water, and how a couple of pigeons managed to stay still for the full eight seconds!&#8221; The result came in eleventh place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MK_30537_Spielbank_Wiesbaden.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54458\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/14/wiki-loves-monuments-international-winners/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3830,2553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Martin Kraft&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 40D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1361965483&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;15&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.8&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"MK_30537_Spielbank_Wiesbaden\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=580&#038;h=387\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-54458\" src=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=580&#038;h=387\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=580&amp;h=387 580w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=1160&amp;h=774 1160w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mk_30537_spielbank_wiesbaden.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Roulette and poker tables feature in <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Martin_Kraft\">Martin Kraft</a>&#8216;s twelfth-place photo of the casino inside Wiesbaden, Germany&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurhaus,_Wiesbaden\">Kurhaus</a>.

I had to wait till 11:30pm for the coloured lights to be switched off, leaving just white light. The image was a 32 second exposure at f11 ISO 100 taken from the middle of the Harbour Bridge &#8230; The middle of the bridge was the toughest spot for a long exposure—every time a truck or train went past, the vibrations ruined the shot. Still, it was also the best spot to get a great angle of the house.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">To make the situation more interesting, my camera battery was about to die and shot after shot was being ruined by the trucks and trains.  Then a passerby happened to walk past, a visitor to Sydney, and asked for his photo to be taken. I didn’t have the heart to refuse &#8230; and got a nice shot of him with the Opera House in the background.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">So then it was back to trying to get the shot of the opera house with &#8230; a dying battery and getting a clear 30 seconds without any heavy vehicles crossing the bridge. I was wondering if I might have to come back another night to try again, but after a few more attempts I finally got it—with moments to spare before the battery finally died.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Ed_Erhart_(WMF)\"><em>Ed Erhart</em></a><em>, Senior Editorial Associate, Communications<br />\nWikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong><em>Want to see more?

PIH complements its clinical services with outreach programs. APZU conducts weekly community events where we screen Neno residents for a wide array of diseases, catching health problems early and referring patients to health centers for treatment. APZU Community Health Workers (CHW) also visit people in their homes. Our cadre of 1,200 CHWs support the health needs of entire households and accompany household members to clinics for care.</p>\n<p>Following work at PIH sites in Rwanda and Lesotho, OpenMRS began at APZU (Neno district in Malawi) in 2007, in conjunction with the launch of testing and treatment programs for HIV and TB. By 2010, six health facilities in Neno were providing ART to nearly 3,000 patients. There are currently 13,000 patients enrolled in OpenMRS. In the past 10 years, much innovation has come from collaboration between APZU clinical sta , Monitoring &amp; Evaluation, Ministry of Health, and PIH Medical Informatics.</p>\n<h2>Goals of APZU OpenMRS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Register patients who have been enrolled into integrated chronic care at all facilities</li>\n<li>Keep records of all patient encounters</li>\n<li>Have a central manageable repository of patient data for data analysis for decision making</li>\n<li>Help providers with decision making</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The System</h1>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4202\" src=\"http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-3.40.41-PM-300x171.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-3.40.41-PM-300x171.png 300w, http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-3.40.41-PM-768x437.png 768w, http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-14-at-3.40.41-PM-1024x583.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Our system includes 2 parent servers (located in Upper Neno and Lower Neno) and 14 child servers (8 in Upper Neno and 6 in Lower Neno). This design is due to connectivity and geographic issues. The APZU Informatics Team utilizes the sync module of OpenMRS to synchronize with the parent database to transfer the latest patient data.</p>\n<p>Child servers have been installed locally on laptops so the informatics team can capture encounters at the facilities.</p>\n<p>These enable teams in Upper and Lower Neno to connect to the internal network and still be able to synchronize data to the parent servers. Data from the system is used by the monitoring and evaluation team and various other stakeholders for informed decisions by clinical, procurement and administration teams. Several reports have been built into the system that help with retrieval of data for different client cohorts.

Now a year in, the <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/explore-topics/wikipedia-libraries.html\">OCLC Wikipedia + Libraries: Better Together</a> project has had a major impact on Wikipedia literacy among librarians in the United States, having introduced hundreds of staff to Wikipedia&#8217;s policies and community practices. Here&#8217;s more about this innovative approach to Wikipedia outreach and library work, and what you can learn from it for &#8220;GLAM&#8221;—galleries, libraries, archives, and museums—education projects in your own communities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">———</p>\n<p>At the center of the 18-month project is <a href=\"https://www.webjunction.org/\">WebJunction</a>, OCLC’s library learning program, to research and deliver Wikipedia awareness and educational opportunities, including a nine-week online professional development course for US public library staff. To support the project, OCLC brought on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_residence\">Wikipedian-in-residence</a>: <a href=\"https://monikasengul.com/\">Monika Sengul-Jones</a>, an advocate for Wikipedia literacy in education and a communication and media studies scholar working fulltime with the Seattle-based WebJunction team. She facilitates project research and outreach, including the design and delivery of <a href=\"https://learn.webjunction.org/login/index.php\">the course</a>.</p>\n<p>With Sengul-Jones’s support, the project has successfully introduced more than six hundred library staff to the inner workings of Wikipedia with webinars and a nine-week live online course that took place during the fall of 2017. In the coming months, the project will continue to support libraries as they put plans of engagement into action, and will be hosting <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/events/webjunction/wikipedia-1lib1ref.html\">Citations Needed</a>, a free live webinar open to all on January 10, 2018, on the eve of <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Library/1Lib1Ref\">the #1lib1ref campaign</a>.</p>\n<p>With the scale and impact of this program in the United States, we asked the Wikimedia Foundation’s Alex Stinson to investigate: what can we glean from OCLC’s approach to library staff learning Wikipedia?

It seems to have gone well: every report out I get from you and the team, and volunteers who help with the course, seems to be quite exciting.</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: Thank you, Alex! It has been an honor to join the <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/explore-topics/wikipedia-libraries.html\">OCLC Wikipedia + Libraries </a>project team to strengthen ties between Wikipedia and libraries. Indeed, the nine-week course just wrapped up and it feels like we’ve accomplished something big—and that it’s not over—I feel momentum. What’s most notable is the palpable excitement and shift in perception among library staff. At enrollment, more than seventy percent of the attendees reported they’d never edited Wikipedia and did not consider the encyclopedia relevant to their library. Amongst the library staff we’ve engaged in this project, we’ve seen a mind shift. Now staff are saying ‘yeah, I now know why I should care, I’m excited and knowledgeable enough to tell my colleagues and patrons why they should care, too.’ What’s also made the recent course experience really special is supporting library staff from many different locations, with 299 enrollees from 45 states and 7 countries. We focused on outreach to public libraries,.. In the US, 80% of pubic libraries <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/assets/1/AssetManager/Brief2013_05.pdf\">are small and rural</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: I am incredibly excited that the OCLC WebJunction course focused on working with public libraries. As you probably already know, some of the Wikimedia movement’s most successful at-scale projects have been with public libraries (the</strong><a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Case_studies/Catalonia%27s_Network_of_Public_Libraries\"><strong> work in Catalonia</strong></a><strong>, for example), yet when we put the</strong><a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/node/11131\"><strong> IFLA Public Library Opportunity Paper</strong></a><strong> together, we had a hard time finding examples beyond a small handful of highly visible “case studies”. Did you discover any exciting approaches to “doing Wikipedia in public libraries” when preparing the project? Do you feel like the class generated any new ideas?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: Yes! Public libraries! So full of ideas!</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate some of these ideas with a story from our sixth live session. We had a quick in-class activity, participants brainstormed titles for Wikipedia-related events at the library. They came up with a couple dozen creative titles, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wikipedia is a Verb and a Noun: Learn How and Why</li>\n<li>Wiki Your Tree: How to Use Wikipedia for Genealogy</li>\n<li>Fantastic Facts and Where to Find Them, On and Offline</li>\n<li>Get Smart: Wikipedia for Research</li>\n<li>Gnomes vs Elves: Wikipedia Holiday Throwdown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t these sound like fun? The titles capture participants’ interests with Wikipedia, too. Information literacy. Staff awareness of what’s new with Wikipedia. Genealogy. Local history and culture. Wikipedia for research. And to explain the last suggestion, participants took to the title of “gnome” editor, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome\">which is what veteran Wikipedians have sometimes called editors who make little improvements</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of examples, the ball is in their court, so to speak. The final assignment was to design a plan of action. Some early adopters have already put plans into action, (which I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/librarians-wikipedia-participants.html\">here</a>). In brief, librarians at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton-James_Public_Library\">Morton-James Public Library</a> in Nebraska City, Nebraska, have begun to use Wikipedia to engender digital literacy skills and research discovery in outreach workshops they run with students. A few libraries have hosted edit-a-thons and panel discussions, and others had conversation starters with their directors and staff. That is just a glimpse of what’s to come—I think the GLAM-Wiki community is in for a real treat. In the coming months we’ll be supporting and sharing the implementation of these plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: There is an odd power dynamic that “doing outreach with libraries” creates, especially when librarians are under increased pressure to expand their services without additional resources. This is especially true if you are not a librarian and you are working for an organization that benefits a lot from libraries (like Wikipedia or OCLC). We both have academic researcher backgrounds that make us familiar with library work, but I always feel a bit on the edge of the library profession during outreach because I have never been “in the trenches”.  How did you navigate these tensions? What did you learn about working with libraries when you are not a librarian?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: Yes, thanks for asking. While I am not a librarian, I joined a project team of library professionals at OCLC. <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/about-us/our-team.html#Sharon_Streams\">Sharon Streams</a> (@thinktower), the director of WebJunction, and <a href=\"https://www.oclc.org/research/people/proffitt.html\">Merrilee Proffitt</a> (@MerrileeIAm), senior program officer and a longtime champion of Wikipedia, designed an incredible project that I was lucky to join last March.</p>\n<p>The first months of the project were spent listening and learning. For me, that was by listening to my team and public library staff. The OCLC WebJunction team—which has nearly twenty years of experience in delivering online ongoing professional education to library staff—assured me that if you approach public library staff with a thoughtful request for information, staff are generous with their answers and want to help you learn. Sure enough, I found it easy to connect because library staff were eager to have their voices heard! I did two dozen phone interviews, went to my public library to observe daily life, had virtual chats with libraries across the US, joined public library listservs, viewed recordings of panels and webinars, and read books and articles written by library professionals about their work and the history of public libraries.</p>\n<p>This kind of listening was fruitful because once we understood existing perceptions of Wikipedia by library staff, we could then consider why the online encyclopedia might matter to their missions and visions. The project design and delivery ultimately emerged from this research, and so there was a long lead time for course design. As I mentioned earlier, we discovered that more than seventy percent of library staff reported they had never edited, but libraries provide many services and use sophisticated technical tools. I also learned that library staff try out things, but with Wikipedia, many had not realized the changes that Wikipedia has gone through over the past decade. So our program emerged as a cultural introduction to Wikipedia for libraries to help them understand why it might matter to them now.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: I really like that approach: really deeply listening and engaging with the community that you want to connect with. It seems like that research really worked out well: You profiled librarians about how they use Wikipedia in a blog series. What stood out?  Can you share a few of their stories?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: That’s right. The <a href=\"https://www.webjunction.org/search-results.html?result-search-terms=%22librarians+who+wikipedia%22&amp;q=%22librarians+who+wikipedia%22&amp;rfilter=allfilter&amp;num=&amp;lr=\">Librarians Who Wikipedia interview series</a> on WebJunction began as a way to start connecting the dots between library staff across the US who were already engaged in Wikipedia, and to show others who were eager to learn how the alignment between libraries and Wikipedia works. It’s been a ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell\">show, don’t tell</a>’ approach, turning research into meaningful awareness. And it’s continuing; we will be publishing more stories in the months to come.</p>\n<p>Each story is eye-opening! I’ll share a few: <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/librarians-wikipedia-susan.html\">Susan Barnum</a>, a public service librarian at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso_Public_Library\">El Paso Public Library</a> in Texas, has edited Wikipedia to answer patron reference questions. Someone asked for references about the history of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahuita\">Chihuahuita</a>, a border neighborhood in El Paso. She saw there was no Wikipedia article, so she shared the references she compiled by editing Wikipedia. Doing this, she reached more than 1,500 (and counting) additional information seekers who viewed the page. Susan’s done much more on Wikipedia—but this one example encapsulates her visionary way of using Wikipedia to serve her community and beyond.</p>\n<p>In Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/librarians-wikipedia-allison.html\">Allison Frick</a>, a youth services librarian, hosted a one-hour basic information literacy program highlighting Wikipedia while providing basic internet literacy instruction. In Florida, <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/librarians-wikipedia-paul.html\">Paul Flagg</a>, a newly minted MLIS graduate on staff at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa%E2%80%93Hillsborough_County_Public_Library_System\">Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library</a> in Florida, was concerned with misrepresentation and inequalities online and coordinated Wiki-Equality editing events at his library.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: What’s been the response? </strong></p>\n<p>Library staff appreciate hearing from their peers, definitely. We’ve gotten enthusiastic feedback about the articles and then about the ten library staff who made guest presentations during webinars. Our live guest presenters were incredible and I must recognize them, in order of appearance: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kosboot\">Bob Kosovsky</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:McGhiever\">János McGhie</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Megalibrarygirl\">Susan Barnum</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kerry_Raymond\">Kerry Raymond</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JacintaJS\">Jacinta Sutton</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vizzylane\">Rajene Hardeman</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/afrocrowdit?lang=en\">Sherry Antoine</a>.</p>\n<p>Participants also learned from the thoughtfulness and savviness of fifteen Wikimedians who accepted<a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/wikipedia-guides.html\"> our invitation to join the training program as Wikipedia guides</a>. Allow me to give a special shout out to, for their incredible participation in enabling human-to-human connections, in alphabetical order: <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Avery_Jensen\">Avery Jensen</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexandre_Hocquet\">Alexandre Hocquet</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Gamaliel\">Gamaliel</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:JacintaJS\">JacintaJS</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jackiekoerner\">Jackie Koerner</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kerry_Raymond\">Kerry Raymond</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Librarygurl\">Librarygurl</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Megalibrarygirl\">Megalibrarygirl</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Megs\">Megs</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Merrilee\">Merrilee</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PersnicketyPaul\">PersnicketyPaul</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:RachelWex\">Rachelwex</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Slowking4\">slowking4</a>, <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sodapopinski7\">Sodapopinski7</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vizzylane\">Vizzylane</a>.  Both the guides and guest presenters engaged in live sessions and course spaces over our nine weeks (and beyond) together. Feedback so far leads me to believe the learning has been multidirectional.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: One of the overwhelmingly common experiences I have when doing outreach with librarians is the absolute delight and surprise that comes from library communities when they realize the values and practices Wikimedians have adopted for shepherding knowledge are very similar to theirs. I’m wondering: What kinds of topics resonated the most with the groups you worked with?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: Yes! This exactly. Library staff have been delighted to discover there’s a community behind Wikipedia, and to actually get to know some of them as presenters and guides. That human-to-human connection is key, and helped to bring alive the ideal that Wikimedia is made out of a community committed to expanding free access to knowledge, they could then connect how the community aligns with libraries.</p>\n<p>Hearing about the editorial processes and policies was interesting for library staff. Many appreciated the spirit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars\">the five pillars</a>.</p>\n<p>“The five pillars&#8230;. are awesome [and] remind me a lot of what I love about working in the public library,” wrote a librarian from a small library. “Free information, no opinions, suggestions when offered and lots of people who love to help people find information.”</p>\n<p>Wikipedians may be too close to realize how many unusual and exciting aspects of this otherwise ubiquitous online platform there are, which sometimes makes it hard to see the humans who make it work. For me it’s been exciting to facilitate library staff’s ah-ha moments about the community and the vision of Wikimedia in a structured learning environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: What was the most bizarre/interesting/funny thing that happened during the development/deployment of the course?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: You know, librarians are supportive and sharp. They have “superior evaluation skills,” as one Wikipedian who participated in the course as a guide observed. And as I mentioned, the favored pillar is four: “Treat others with civility and respect.” More of this! Participants asked right away, how do you tag other editors and let them know they’ve done something great. They really took to “thanking,” sharing wiki-love and appreciate barnstars. The experience with them has been so affirming.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: What areas of our community did you see as “surprises” which we need to communicate better as Wikimedians?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: It shouldn’t come as a surprise, in fact, that library staff are smart and they’re accustomed to learning new informational systems. So what might surprise other Wikimedians is that it’s not for lack of skills that library staff haven’t participated in the Wikipedia project. Rather, somewhere along the line they just never got engaged as Wikipedia has grown. So we’re giving them the cultural know-how, the reason, and confidence to trust Wikipedia and believe they can and should participate—be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold\">BOLD</a>—by demonstrating what’s in it for them and their communities, and building human-to-human connections. This approach is a win-win for Wikimedia and public libraries.</p>\n<p>One of our assignments was to observe the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Teahouse\">Teahouse</a>. Let me share two comments:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">“In following the fourth <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pillars\">pillar of Wikipedia</a>, more than one Teahouse Wikipedian conversed with the obviously frustrated new editor in a calm and rational manner. This was impressive and encouraging to me as a new editor.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">“I am most impressed by the time that [Teahouse] editors put into their thoughtful responses, many making sure that the question is properly answered and the solution or information offered is understood. I am starting to believe that Wikipedians are all really reference librarians at heart.”</p>\n<p>This is huge! When librarians see themselves <em>in </em>Wikipedians, they have trust in the community, confidence that they can decide for themselves what to do next, and know where to go for help.</p>\n<p>That said, in terms of user experience, a few have gotten turned around navigating wiki-markup on Talk and community pages. Let’s implement VE on all Wikimedia pages—not just articles—and make it easier to communicate and share <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiLove\">wiki-love.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Alex: What visualization or illustration best represents the work that you have been doing with the course?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: I love the WebJunction live online webinar experience. Picture this: hundreds of people at hundreds of libraries across the US online at the same time. This is scaled adult learning at its best—it’s a classroom, a town hall, and a radio show! Our live sessions (which were recorded and will be shared with course materials on WebJunction under CC BY-SA 4.0 in spring 2018), consist of beautiful slides, pdf learner guides to contextualize the content, animated instructors and guest presenters, a closed captioner transforming voices into text, and an active chat channel for conversation during the presentations—text is flying. It’s exciting. Then, we use annotation tools periodically during the session to enhance interactivity. Annotation is the ability to use, on screen and all together, checkmarks, pointers, and highlighters on slides.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54437\" class=\"post-image wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_was_your_editing_experience_live_session_4.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54437\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/13/monika-sengul-jones-interview/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1088,812\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Sengul-Jones (Contractor),Monika&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1507716286&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"how was your editing experience live session 4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=580&#038;h=433\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54437\" src=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=580&#038;h=433\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=580&amp;h=433 580w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224 300w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=573 768w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/how-was-your-editing-experience-live-session-4.jpg 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_was_your_editing_experience_live_session_4.jpg\">Image</a> by Monika Sengul-Jones, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p></div>\n<p>Check out this screenshot taken after participants were assigned to make their first edits—make a copy edit and add a citation. Consider this the equivalent of a group photo, it’s neat.</p>\n<p><strong>Alex: It seems like the class provided a really powerful and engaging environment for learning about the Wikimedia community. Conversely, what can Wikipedia learn from public libraries?</strong></p>\n<p>Monika: Thanks for asking this question. First I want to recognize that the Wikimedia community, and Wikipedia, has already been learning from libraries because librarians are a part of the Wikimedia community! This project is building on the connections and lessons learned from the <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM\">GLAM-Wiki</a> community, <a href=\"http://artandfeminism.org\">Art + Feminism</a>, <a href=\"http://afrocrowd.org\">AfroCROWD</a>, <a href=\"https://nyc.wikimedia.org/wiki/Home\">Wikimedia New York City</a>, <a href=\"https://wikimediadc.org/wiki/Home\">Wikimedia D.C</a>., the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Library\"> Wikipedia Library</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Library_User_Group\">Wikipedia Library User Group</a>. I’m also building on my own experiences and lessons learned working with the<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Full_Circle_Gap_Protocol:_Addressing_the_Unknown_Unknowns\"> Wiki Education Foundation and feminist academics</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I think continuing to support these connections between libraries and Wikimedians will help them become sustainable, built on a foundation of trust and affinity. And it’s happening! A sign to me of strengthened ties is the fact that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w88gMwgRgYI\">Dr. Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGLeySUrZz8\">Katherine Maher, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation were both keynote speakers at </a>OCLC’s Americas Regional Council meeting on Oct. 30-31<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGLeySUrZz8\">.</a> Their keynotes were complementary. However, in terms of Wikimedians learning from libraries, what stood out to me was really how young Wikimedia is compared to public libraries, which Katherine Maher described. And I say young even though Wikipedia is one of the early internet projects that has endured, and matured, in the messy rise of a digital networked and commercial economy. Dr. Hayden gave us a longer view of the history of libraries, which date back hundreds of years. “We are the original search engines,” she said. She also motioned to the significance of the position she holds, Librarian of Congress, as an African American woman: “I am a descendent of people who were forbidden to read,” she said.</p>\n<p>What a tribute Dr. Hayden’s presentation was to the long history of work that libraries have done—and continue to do—to ensure equitable access to information for all in the face of deep systemic injustices to too many lives. I think it’s important for Wikimedians to recognize that the successful, broad institutionalization of public libraries that we have today in the United States—where there are more public libraries than <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/116937/would-you-believe-there-are-more-libraries-than-starbucks-or-mcdonalds/\">Starbucks or McDonald’s restaurants</a>—is the outcome of sweat, advocacy, and professionalization accomplished by library staff and devoted champions of literacy for democracy. And libraries have had to redress deeply rooted, complicated historic and geographical legacies of violence, oppression and inequity—including <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/introduction-to-public-librarianship/oclc/701243162\">inaccessible and segregated libraries</a>—to achieve this.</p>\n<p>Redress isn’t finished. Public libraries today are reinventing their professional practices to ensure access for all. Libraries provide many services—social work, for instance—because a substantial portion of the people that public libraries serve in the United States <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespoor\">face chronic life insecurities</a>. Public libraries partner with community agencies to address, for example, the nationwide opioid crisis. Libraries<a href=\"https://www.webjunction.org/news/webjunction/opioid-crisis-town-hall-recap.html\"> train staff</a> on the use of naloxone to reverse overdoses. Libraries are also<a href=\"http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2015/03/summer-meal-programming-at-the-library/\"> kitchens, feeding hungry children</a>. I’ve heard of librarians running literacy programs in public housing, at barber shops and farmers markets—radical reinventions of the work of an information professional.</p>\n<p>I am in awe of the ingenuity of public libraries. As we, Wikimedians, look to a future where the best of the Wikimedia movement can root more deeply and meaningfully in our networked civic life, let’s listen and learn from public libraries. I’d also invite Wikimedians to consider public libraries as co-collaborators and role models as we look forward to the exciting challenge of realizing the<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017\"> 2030 strategic direction</a> for a future of knowledge as service and knowledge equity.</p>\n<p><strong>AS: Is there anything else you’d like to add?</strong></p>\n<p>MSJ: View or participate live in <a href=\"http://learn.webjunction.org/\">a WebJunction webinar</a>! You can experience the excitement of library life with WebJunction. That might sound cheesy, but it’s true. WebJunction is able to bring a large cross-section of library staff from across the country together to learn side-by-side. This is diversity that can be missing at larger professional conferences, which can be expensive or difficult to attend. Webinars are free, accessible, and open to all (browse the webinar calendar<a href=\"https://www.webjunction.org/events/webjunction.html\"> here</a>). Wikimedians may find themselves delighted by the ways that libraries thoughtfully address topics that matter to our community, such as civility. WebJunction’s most popular course is <a href=\"http://learn.webjunction.org/enrol/index.php?id=99\">“Dealing with Difficult Patrons</a>” (to view this and other free webinars, you will need to<a href=\"https://learn.webjunction.org/login/signup.php?\"> create a free WebJunction account</a> first).</p>\n<p>Wikimedians interested in learning more from libraries are warmly invited to attend our next Wikipedia webinar, <a href=\"http://www.webjunction.org/events/webjunction/wikipedia-1lib1ref.html\">Citations Needed: Build Your Wikipedia Skills While Building the World’s Encyclopedia</a>. This free webinar will build on our existing momentum and support library staff interested in adding citations to Wikipedia; the event will be on <strong>January 10, 2018 at 3pm EST, </strong> with Emily Jack from UNC Chapel Hill Libraries joining me as a guest presenter to kick off participation in the Wikipedia Library’s <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Library/1Lib1Ref\">#1lib1ref campaign</a> from Jan. 15 – Feb. 3, 2018.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to mention that we share project updates—such as reminders about this webinar—in the Wikipedia + Libraries <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wikilibmail\">monthly newsletter</a>, and post in the <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Newsletter\">GLAM-Wiki newsletter</a> too.</p>\n<p>A final comment: What has become clear to me in the course of joining this project is that humans have no shortage of information about and of our worlds. But equitable access to information, it’s an enduring problem. As Kathleen de la Peña McCook writes on page 66 <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/introduction-to-public-librarianship/oclc/701243162\">in her textbook on public librarianship</a>, equity is both “simple in concept and complex in implementation.” But by working together, Wikimedians and libraries are stronger and better equipped to address the complexities of access, and motivated by a shared value that “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpPnuSvCJLY\">knowledge belongs to all of us</a>.”</p>\n<p>Thanks again Alex for the interview, the support of GLAM-Wiki, and the

It’s a driving concern for me and other members of the <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Technology#Search_Platform\">Search Platform team</a>, and also for many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal\">community</a> members, like those who create and curate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect\">redirects</a>.</p>\n<p>But the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge\">curse of knowledge</a> makes it difficult for more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophistication_(complexity_theory)\">sophisticated</a> Wikipedians to put themselves <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)#Philosophy\">in the shoes</a> of a wiki <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/newbie#English\">newbie</a> who is confused by the sea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_link\">blue links</a> sprinkled with <span style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><a style=\"color:#ff0000;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_link\">red links</a></span>, and who doesn’t yet fully understand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability\">notability</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming\">naming conventions</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines\">talk pages</a>, or<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Searching\"> search</a>.</p>\n<p>What do such newbies need, how do they look for it, and can we help them find <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang\">it‽</a></p>\n<h4>Unearth and extract!</h4>\n<p>This vicarious fear of missing out leads many people to an awesome idea; it’s an idea that I myself had shortly after I joined the Foundation; it’s an idea others on my team had had a while <em>before</em> I joined them; it’s an idea that many people have proposed and re-proposed and debated and argued about and <em>not quite</em> come to <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fisticuffs\">fisticuffs</a> over:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Let’s mine the most frequent queries that get no results, figure out what users are looking for, and arrange to provide it to them—possibly in the form of new articles or redirects from the failed query terms to appropriate existing articles.</em></p>\n<p>It seems like it should be an easy win: Wikipedia gets a steady stream of useful new information, fewer searches get no results at all, and fewer newbies fail to find what they are looking for. But, as is so common, things are more complicated than they first appear.</p>\n<h4>Privacy, publicity, and prankery</h4>\n<p>The most important issue is <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy\">privacy</a>. People sometimes accidentally reveal their private information in their searches. A name, email address, social media account, phone number, physical address, IP address, national ID number, credit card number, love letter, secret recipe, etc., etc.—all can be inadvertently copied from somewhere and pasted into a search box. And, given the million of users of hundreds of Wikipedias and their sister projects, it not only <em>can</em> happen, it <em>does</em> happen—fairly regularly. So, a big raw dump of search data is out of the question.</p>\n<p>Several automated methods of preventing the exposure of personal information have been suggested, and many may even be 99.9% effective. The problem is that a 0.1% failure rate multiplied by millions of cases is still thousands of potential privacy problems, when even one is too many.</p>\n<p>It is possible to use patterns to identify likely personal information like email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers, but errors, unexpected formats, and unknown types of data mean there is always <em>something</em> that can slip through.</p>\n<p>Another proposed approach is to require a minimum number of distinct searchers (i.e., distinct <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address\">IP addresses</a>). After all, if a hundred people have searched for the same thing, it must actually be a thing, right? But a well-placed link on social media (say, in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%54%72%65%79%20%77%72%69%74%65%73%20%74%68%65%20%62%65%73%74%20%62%6c%6f%67%20%70%6f%73%74%73%21\">blog post</a>) can easily generate hundreds or thousands of queries, because some people will click on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%49%20%73%61%69%64%2c%20%54%72%65%79%20%77%72%69%74%65%73%20%74%68%65%20%62%65%73%74%20%62%6c%6f%67%20%70%6f%73%74%73%21\">almost anything</a>.</p>\n<p>Since Wikipedia is a such a high-profile website, it’s easy to imagine people trying to game such a system, whether for the fleeting fame or just “<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/for_the_lulz\">for the lulz</a>”. Aspiring celebrities could easily mobilize a relatively small number of fans to propel their brand to the top of such a list. And you never know what will strike the internet’s fickle fancy—which is how we got <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface\"><em>Boaty McBoatface</em></a><em>. </em>Roving bands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll\">internet trolls</a> have famously done much worse in online polls for Mountain Dew in 2012, the <em>Time</em> 100 list in 2009, and countless others.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<h4>Diamond in the rough or needle in a haystack?</h4>\n<p>Thus, while the expected return on mining the most frequent failed queries is often high, the potential risk is also large.

The result was a corpus of about 8.6 million queries, with 7.4 million <em>unique</em> queries. I carefully reviewed the top 100 most frequent queries, and skimmed the top 1,000.</p>\n<p>What I found, mostly, was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%70%65%6f%70%6c%65%20%77%69%6c%6c%20%63%6c%69%63%6b%20%6f%6e%20%61%6c%6d%6f%73%74%20%41%4e%59%54%48%49%4e%47\">porn</a>.</p>\n<p>The most common query is the name of a porn site. It <em>always</em> shows up in my data when I look at poorly performing queries. In this case, I found five variants of it in the top 100, and they account for about 29% of the raw query count for the top 100.</p>\n<p>Other common categories for these searches are other websites, internet memes, TV shows and movies, internet personalities, porn stars, people mentioned in recent news, historical figures, politicians, etc.</p>\n<p>I don’t have any opinions on the notability of any particular person or website, but while some of these are clearly popular (based on searches), they have been deemed not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability\">notable</a> <em>by the </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_community\"><em>English Wikipedia community</em></a><em>.</em> The most frequent porn site, the two most frequent internet personalities, a couple of other sites, and a couple of the internet memes show up in the deletion logs as having been created—some of them multiple times—and deleted. Two articles (with different capitalization) for the most frequent porn site were deleted in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016.</p>\n<p>There were also a few typos, but almost all of them were corrected by the completion suggester (suggestions made while you type) and the “did you mean” spelling correction (suggestions made after you submit your query).</p>\n<p><strong>Small value, diminishing returns</strong></p>\n<p>Over an entire month, only 281 distinct queries passed the proposed 100-unique-IPs threshold, and the 1000th most-frequent query was only searched for 48 times.</p>\n<p>The top 100 most frequent queries only accounted for 0.62% of the 8.7M queries, and the top 1,000 only accounted for 1.45% of all queries. The top 25,000 most frequent queries didn’t quite account for 5% of all the queries, and 25,000th had a frequency of 7. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\">long tail</a> is <em>very</em> long.</p>\n<p>In the top 1000, there were at least 10 obvious addresses, a phone number, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number\">ISBN</a> number, an obfuscated email address, a Twitter account, and two instances of a person + city—so aggregating over longer time periods than a month does increase the likelihood of personal data making it past an IP-count filter, validating our privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>I gathered the same data for the following month, June 2016, and found it to be very similar. The top 10 most frequent queries were the same as in May, and 71 of the top 100 were the same, indicating that there isn’t a lot of new information at month-over-month timescales.</p>\n<p>Some of the same street addresses from May showed up in the June data, indicating to me that the query is likely coming from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%70%65%6f%70%6c%65%20%77%69%6c%6c%20%63%6c%69%63%6b%20%6f%6e%20%61%6c%6d%6f%73%74%20%41%4e%59%54%48%49%4e%47\">link</a> on the internet, or a better class of bot.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit\">Brexit</a> vote took place in June 2016, and I found 8 misspellings of <em>Brexit</em> in the top 1000 for June—though none in the top 100. Most were corrected by either the completion suggester or the “did you mean” spelling correction.</p>\n<p>You can find even more detail about all this in the <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:TJones_(WMF)/Notes/Top_Unsuccessful_Search_Queries\">write up</a> I did last summer.</p>\n<h4>What went <del>wrong</del> right?</h4>\n<p>Great minds think alike—so everyone who thought this sounded like a promising idea should give themselves a pat on the back, because lots of other smart people thought so, too.</p>\n<p>So what went wrong? Nothing! What went <em>right?</em> My <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unproven\">intuition</a> is that, at least on English Wikipedia, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome\">WikiGnomes</a> are so far ahead of the curve that they render this mining exercise moot. There are already so many carefully created and curated articles and redirects that the vast majority of queries that otherwise would have failed, don’t. (<a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:CirrusSearch\">CirrusSearch</a>, which the <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Staff_and_contractors#Search_Platform\">Search Platform hobgoblins</a> work on tirelessly, probably helps a bit, too.)</p>\n<p>For other large wikis, particularly Wikipedias, I would <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unproven\">expect</a> similar results. Smaller wikis may have a better failed-query gem-to-dung ratio than English Wikipedia, but privacy concerns are still <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incontrovertible\">paramount</a>, and the long tail is <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unproven\">probably</a> still very, very long.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:TJones_(WMF)\">Trey Jones</a>, Senior Software Engineer, Search Platform<br />\nWikimedia Foundation</em></p>\n<h4>Footnotes</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t feed the trolls!

The <a href=\"https://2018.fossasia.org\">FOSSASIA OpenTechSummit</a> is taking place from March 22-25, 2018 under the tagline “The Open Conversational Web” with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence and Cloud for the Industry 4.0. More than 200 speakers will fly in to present at the event. International exhibitors will showcase their latest advancements and meet developers in a careers fair.</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://2018.fossasia.org\">FOSSASIA Open Tech Summit</a> is an annual tech event featuring tech icons from around the world since 2009. The event is all about the latest and greatest open source technologies and their impact and applications on business and society. With more than 3,000 attendees the FOSSASIA Summit is the biggest gathering of Open Source developers and businesses in Asia. A great feature of 2018 is the expanded exhibition space where tech businesses, SMEs and startups converge with developers and customers and meet potential candidates in a careers fair.</p>\n<p>“The goal of the FOSSASIA Summit is to bring together developers, technologists and businesses to collaborate, share and explore the full potential of open source to create opportunities for new industries. And, right now there is a shift happening where users increasingly communicate through their voice with computer applications enhanced by Open Source AI technologies.“, says Ms. Hong Phuc Dang, chair of the summit and continues: “We expect to see interesting new voice gadgets to try out at the event. And, attendees will be able to learn how to develop solutions for these new voice interface devices here.”</p>\n<p>Associate Professor Lim Tit Meng, CE of Science Centre adds: “Technologies like Big Data, AI and VR, and the web itself are becoming more open and conversational. They are also the engines behind the Industry 4.0 innovations. The open source community, with its spirit of co-creation and sharing is at the forefront of conversations on the web. At Science Centre Singapore, we aim to showcase and create content using these technologies and look forward to learning from and working with the open source community.”</p>\n<p>The call for speakers is open and “we are seeing a large increase in proposals this year” says Mr. Mario Behling from the FOSSASIA Summit committee. Speakers are expected from companies such as car manufacturer Daimler, tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Samsung, Intel and from many Singapore startups with topics ranging from algorithms and cognitive experts to DevOps, cloud containers, Blockchain and Neurotechnologies. Voice assistants and Open Source development solutions for SUSI.AI, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, Siri, and solutions using Nuance or IBM Watson are a big topic.</p>\n<p>Tickets are available on the website <a href=\"https://2018.fossasia.org\">2018.fossasia.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://2018.fossasia.org/press/\"><strong>press representatives</strong> signup is here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Event page <a href=\"http://2018.fossasia.org/\">http://2018.fossasia.org</a></li>\n<li>Royalty-Free/Freely Licensed Images: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/fossasia-2017-singapore/\">www.flickr.com/groups/fossasia-2017-singapore/</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fossasia\">http://twitter.com/fossasia</a></li>\n<li>Facebook: <a href=\"https://facebook.com/fossasia\">https://facebook.com/fossasia</a></li>\n<li>Call for speakers <a href=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2018-singapore-call-for-speakers\">https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2018-singapore-call-for-speakers</a></li>\n<li>FOSSASIA Summit 2017 Recap <a href=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2017-wrap-up\">https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2017-wrap-up</a></li>\n</ul>\n","published":"2017-12-11T16:17:14.000Z","author":"Mario Behling","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/fossasia-summit-2018-the-open-conversational-web-with-open-source-ai/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":""}},{"title":"Discover a world of natural heritage through the winning images from Wiki Loves Earth","content":"<div id=\"attachment_54326\" class=\"post-image wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54326\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/11/wiki-loves-earth-international-winners/baikal/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"7238,4831\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Sergey Pesterev&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D800&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1454035075&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 Sergey Pesterev 2016&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;16&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.002&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Baikal&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Ogoy island in winter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=580&#038;h=387\" class=\"wp-image-54326 size-large\" src=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=580&#038;h=387\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=580&amp;h=387 580w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=1160&amp;h=774 1160w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg?w=768&amp;h=513 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wiki Love Earth&#8217;s overall winner: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogoy_Island\">Ogoy Island</a> in Russia&#8217;s Lake Baikal. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ogoy_island_in_winter.jpg\">Photo</a> by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Black_Sickle\">Sergey Pesterev</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p></div>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A jaguar gazed out from a bed of shrubs.

Introducing Thumbor replaces an existing service, and as such it&#8217;s important that it doesn&#8217;t preform worse than its predecessor. We came up with a strategy to reach feature parity and ensure a launch that would be invisible to end users.</p>\n<h4>Development</h4>\n<p>In Wikimedia production, Thumbor was due to interact with several services: Varnish, Swift, Nginx, Memcached, Poolcounter. In order to iron out those interactions, it was important to reproduce them locally during development. Which is why I wrote several roles for the official <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Vagrant\">MediaWiki Vagrant</a> machine, with help from <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/bd808/\"><strong>@bd808</strong></a>. Those have already been useful to other developers, with several people reaching out to me about the Varnish and Swift Vagrant roles. While at the time it might have seemed like an unnecessary quest (why not develop straight on a production machine?) it was actually a great learning experience to write the extensive Puppet code required to make it work. While it&#8217;s a separate codebase, subsequent work to port that over to production Puppet was minimal.</p>\n<p>This phase actually represented the bulk of the work, reproducing support for all the media formats and special parameters found in MediaWiki thumbnailing. I dedicated a lot of attention to making sure that the images generated by Thumbor were as good as what MediaWiki was outputting for the same original media. In order to do that, I wrote many integration tests using thumbnails from Wikimedia production, which were used as reference output. Those tests are still part of the Thumbor plugins Debian package and ensure that we avoid regressions. They use a DSSIM algorithm to visually compare images and make sure that what Thumbor outputs doesn&#8217;t visually diverge from the reference thumbnails. We also compare file size to make sure that the new output isn&#8217;t significantly heavier than the old.</p>\n<h4>Packaging</h4>\n<p>The next big phase of the project was to create a Debian package for our Thumbor code. I had never done that before and it wasn&#8217;t as difficult as some people make it out to be (I imagine the tooling has gotten significantly better than it used to be), at least for Python packages. However, in order to be able to ship our code as a Debian package, Thumbor itself needed to have a Debian package. Which wasn&#8217;t the case at the time. Some people had tried on much older versions of Thumbor but never reached the point where it was put in Debian proper. Since that last attempt, Thumbor added a lot of new dependencies that weren&#8217;t packaged either. <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/p/fgiunchedi/\"><strong>@fgiunchedi</strong></a> and I worked on packaging it all and successfully did so. And with the help of Debian developer Marcelo Jorge Vieira who pushed most of those packaged for us into Debian, we crossed the finish line recently and got <a href=\"https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/thumbor_6.3.2-1.html\">Thumbor submitted to Debian unstable</a>.</p>\n<p>One advantage of doing this is that it makes deployment of updates really straightforward, with the integration test suite I mentioned earlier running in isolation when the Debian package is built. With those Debian packages done, we were ready to run this on production machines.</p>\n<p>But the more important advantage is that by having those Debian packages into Debian itself, other people are using the exact same versions of Thumbor&#8217;s dependencies and Thumbor itself via Debian, thus greatly expanding the exposure of the software we run in production. This increases the likelihood that security issues we might be exposed to are found and fixed.</p>\n<h4>Beta</h4>\n<p>Trying to reproduce the production setup locally is always limited. The full complexity of production configuration isn&#8217;t there, and everything is still running on the same machine. The next step was to convert the Vagrant Puppet code into production Puppet code. Which allowed us to run this on <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Beta_Cluster\">the Beta cluster</a> as a first step, where we could reproduce a setup closer to production with several machines. This was actually an opportunity to improve the Beta cluster to make it have a proper Varnish and Swift setup closer to production than it used to have. Just like the Vagrant improvements, those changes quickly paid off by being useful to others who were working on Beta.</p>\n<p>Just like packaging, this new step revealed bugs in the Thumbor plugins Python code that we were able to fix before hitting production.</p>\n<h4>Pre-production</h4>\n<p>The Beta wikis only have a small selection of media, and as such we still hadn&#8217;t been exposed to the variety of content found on production wikis. I was worried that we would run into media files that had special properties in production that we hadn&#8217;t run into in all the development phase. Which is why I came up with a plan to dual-serve all production requests to the new production Thumbor machines and compare output.</p>\n<p>This consisted in modifications to the production Swift proxy plugin code we have in place to rewrite Wikimedia URLs. Instead of sending thumbnail requests to just MediaWiki, I modified it to also send the same requests to Thumbor. At first completely blindly, the Swift proxy would send requests to Thumbor and not even wait to see the outcome.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the Thumbor error logs and found several files that were problematic for Thumbor and not for MediaWiki. This allowed us to fix many bugs that we would have normally found out about during the actual launch. This was also the opportunity to reproduce and iron out the various throttling mechanisms.</p>\n<p>To be more thorough, I mage the Swift proxy log HTTP status codes returned by MediaWiki and Thumbor and produced a diff, looking for files that were problematic for one and not the other. This allowed us to find more bugs on the Thumbor side, and a few instances of files that Thumbor could render properly that MediaWiki couldn&#8217;t!</p>\n<p>This is also the phase where under the full production load, our Thumbor configuration started showing significant issues around memory consumption and leaks. We were able to fix all those problems in that fire-and-forget dual serving setup, with no impact at all on production traffic. This was an extremely valuable strategy, as we were able to iterate quickly in the same traffic conditions as if the service had actually launched, without any consequences for users.</p>\n<h4>Production</h4>\n<p>With Thumbor running smoothly on production machines, successfully rendering a superset of thumbnails MediaWiki was able to, it was time to launch. The dual-serving logic in the Swift proxy came in very handy: it became a simple toggle between sending thumbnailing traffic to MediaWiki and sending it to Thumbor. And so we did switch. We did that gradually, having more and more wikis&#8217;s thumbnails rendered by Thumbor over the course of a couple of weeks. The load was handled fine (predictable, since we were handling the same load in the dual-serving mode). The success rate of requests based on HTTP status codes was the same before and after.</p>\n<p>However after some time we started getting reports of issues around EXIF orientation. A feature we had integration tests for. But the tests only covered 180 degrees rotation and not 90 degrees (doh!). The Swift proxy switch allowed us to quickly switch traffic back to MediaWiki. We did so because it&#8217;s quite a prevalent feature in JPGs. We fixed that one large bug, switched the traffic back to Thumbor and that was it.</p>\n<p>Some minor bugs surfaced later regarding much less common files with special properties, that we were able to fix very quickly. And deploy fixes for safely and easily with the Debian package. But we could have avoided all of those bugs too if we had been more thorough in the dual-serving phase. We were only comparing HTTP status codes between MediaWiki and Thumbor. However, rendering a thumbnail successfully doesn&#8217;t mean that the visual contents are right! The JPG orientation could be wrong, for example. If I had to do it again, I would have run DSSIM visual comparisons on the live dual-served production traffic between the MediaWiki and Thumbor outputs. That would have definitely surfaced the handful of bugs that appeared post-launch.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>All in all, if you do your homework and are very thorough in testing locally and on production traffic, you can achieve a very smooth launch replacing a core part of infrastructure with completely different software. Despite the handful of avoidable bugs that appeared around the launch, the switch to Thumbor went largely unnoticed by users, which was the original intent, as we were looking for feature parity and ease of swapping the new solution in. Thumbor has been happily serving all Wikimedia production thumbnail traffic since June 2017 in a very stable fashion. This concludes our journey to Thumbor!</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:GDubuc_(WMF)\">Gilles Dubuc</a>, Senior Software Engineer, Performance</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.wikimedia.org&#038;blog=67752302&#038;post=54364&#038;subd=wikimediablog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-09T06:49:00.000Z","author":"Gilles Dubuc","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-development-deployment-strategy/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org","name":"Wikimedia Blog"}},{"title":"The journey to Thumbor, part 2: Thumbnailing architecture","content":"<div id=\"attachment_54360\" class=\"post-image wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahreido/3120877348\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54360\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-rationale/thumbs-up/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3074,1889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XT&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1228671777&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;40&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"thumbs up\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&#038;h=356\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54360\" src=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&#038;h=356\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&amp;h=356 580w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=1160&amp;h=712 1160w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=768&amp;h=472 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahreido/3120877348\">Photo</a> by Sarah Reid via Flickr, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a>.</p></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-rationale/\">Part 1</a> | <strong>Part 2</strong> | <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-development-deployment-strategy/\">Part 3</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Thumbor\">Thumbor</a> has now been serving all public thumbnail traffic for Wikimedia production since late June 2017.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/post/view/55/the_journey_to_thumbor_part_1_rationale/\">a previous blog post</a> I explained the rationale behind that project. To understand why Thumbor is a good fit, it&#8217;s important to understand where it fits in our overall thumbnailing architecture. A lot of historic constraints come into play, where Thumbor could be adapted to meet those needs.</p>\n<h4>The stack</h4>\n<p>Like everything we serve to readers, thumbnails are heavily cached. Unlike wiki pages, there is no distinction in caching of thumbnails between readers and editors, in fact. Our edge is Nginx providing SSL termination, behind which we find Varnish clusters (both frontends and backend), which talk to OpenStack Swift &#8211; responsible for storing media originals as well as thumbnails &#8211; and finally Swift talks to Thumbor (previously MediaWiki).</p>\n<h4>The request lifecycle</h4>\n<p>Nginx concerns itself with SSL and HTTP/2, because Varnish as a project decided to draw a line about Varnish&#8217;s concerns and exclude HTTP/2 support from it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Varnish\">Varnish</a> concerns itself with having a very high cache hit rate for existing thumbnails. When a thumbnail isn&#8217;t found in Varnish, either it has never been requested before, or it fell out of cache for not being requested frequently enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Swift\">Swift</a> concerns itself with long-term storage. We have a historical policy &#8211; which is in the process of being reassessed &#8211; of storing all thumbnails long-term. Which means that when a thumbnail isn&#8217;t in Varnish, there&#8217;s a high likelihood that it&#8217;s found in Swift. Which is why Swift is first in line behind Varnish. When it receives a request for a missing thumbnail from Varnish, the Swift proxy first checks if Swift has a copy of that thumbnail. If not, it forwards that request to Thumbor.</p>\n<p>Thumbor concerns itself with generating thumbnails from original media. When it receives a request from Swift, it requests the corresponding original media from Swift, generates the required thumbnail from that original and returns it. This response is sent back up the call chain, all the way to the client, through Swift and Varnish. After that response is sent, Thumbor saves that thumbnail in Swift. Varnish, as it sees the response go through, keeps a copy as well.</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s out of scope</h4>\n<p>Noticeably absent from the above is uploading, extracting metadata from the original media, etc. All of which are still MediaWiki concerns at upload time. Thumbor doesn&#8217;t try to handle all things media, it is solely a thumbnailing engine. The concern of uploading, parsing and storing the original media is separate. In fact, Thumbor goes as far as trying to fetch as little data about the original from Swift as possible, seeking data transfer efficiency. For example, we have a custom loader for videos that leverages <a href=\"https://www.ffmpeg.org/\">Ffmpeg&#8217;s</a> support for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests\">range requests</a>, only fetching the frames it needs over the network, rather than the whole video.</p>\n<h4>What we needed to add</h4>\n<p>We wanted a thumbnailing service that was &#8220;dumb&#8221;, i.e. didn&#8217;t concern itself with more than thumbnailing. Thumbor definitely provided that, but was too simple for our existing needs, which is why we had to write a number of plugins for it, to add the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New media formats (XCF, DJVU, PDF, WEBM, etc.)</li>\n<li>Smarter handling of giant originals (&gt;1GB) to save memory</li>\n<li>The ability to run multiple format engines at once</li>\n<li>Support for multipage media</li>\n<li>Handling the Wikimedia thumbnail URL format</li>\n<li>Loading originals from Swift</li>\n<li>Loading videos efficiently with range requests</li>\n<li>Saving thumbnails in Swift</li>\n<li>Various forms of throttling</li>\n<li>Live production debugging with <a href=\"https://github.com/ionelmc/python-manhole\">Manhole</a></li>\n<li>Sending logs to ELK</li>\n<li>Wikimedia-specific filters/settings, such as conditional sharpening of JPGs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also changed the images included in the Thumbor project to be respectful of open licenses and wrote Debian packages for all of Thumbor&#8217;s dependencies and Thumbor itself.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>While Thumbor was a good match on the separation of concerns we were looking for, it still required writing many plugins and a lot of extra work to make it a drop-in replacement for MediaWiki&#8217;s media thumbnailing code. The main reason being that Wikimedia sites support types of media files that the web at large cares less about, like giant TIFFs and PDFs.</p>\n<p>In the next blog post, I&#8217;ll describe the development strategy that led to the successful deployment of Thumbor in production.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:GDubuc_(WMF)\">Gilles Dubuc</a>, Senior Software Engineer, Performance</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.wikimedia.org&#038;blog=67752302&#038;post=54363&#038;subd=wikimediablog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-09T06:48:58.000Z","author":"Gilles Dubuc","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-thumbnailing-architecture/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org","name":"Wikimedia Blog"}},{"title":"The journey to Thumbor, part 1: Rationale","content":"<div id=\"attachment_54360\" class=\"post-image wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahreido/3120877348\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54360\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-rationale/thumbs-up/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3074,1889\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XT&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1228671777&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;40&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"thumbs up\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&#038;h=356\" class=\"size-large wp-image-54360\" src=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&#038;h=356\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=580&amp;h=356 580w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=1160&amp;h=712 1160w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w, https://wikimediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/thumbs-up.jpg?w=768&amp;h=472 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahreido/3120877348\">Photo</a> by Sarah Reid via Flickr, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a>.</p></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;<strong>Part 1</strong> | <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-thumbnailing-architecture/\">Part 2</a> | <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-development-deployment-strategy/\">Part 3</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe are currently in the final stages of deploying <a href=\"https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor\">Thumbor</a> to Wikimedia production, where it will generate media thumbnails for all our public wikis. Up until now, MediaWiki was responsible for generating thumbnails.</p>\n<p>I started the project of making Thumbor production-ready for Wikimedia <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T121388\">a year and a half ago</a> and I&#8217;ll talk about this journey in a series of blog posts. In this one, I&#8217;ll explain the rationale behind this project.</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>The biggest reason to change the status quo is security. Since MediaWiki is quite monolithic, deployments of MediaWiki on our server fleet responsible for generating thumbnails aren&#8217;t as isolated as they could be from the rest of our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Media formats being <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-7294/Libpng.html\">a frequent security breach vector</a>, it has always been an objective of ours to isolate thumbnailing more than we currently can with Mediawiki. We run our command-line tools responsible for media conversion inside <a href=\"https://github.com/netblue30/firejail\">firejail</a>, but we could do more to fence off thumbnailing from the rest of what we do.</p>\n<p>One possibility would have been to rewrite the MediaWiki code responsible for thumbnailing, turning it into a series of PHP libraries, that could then be run without MediaWiki, to perform the thumbnailing work we are currently doing &#8211; while untangling the code enough that the thumbnailing servers can be more isolated.</p>\n<p>However such a rewrite would be very expensive and when we can afford to, we prefer to use ready-made open source solutions with a community of their own, rather than writing new tools. It seemed to us that media thumbnailing was far from being a MediaWiki-specific problem and there ought to be open source solutions tackling that issue. We undertook a review of the open source landscape for this problem domain and Thumbor emerged as the clear leader in that area.</p>\n<h4>Maintenance</h4>\n<p>The MediaWiki code responsible for thumbnailing currently doesn&#8217;t have any team ownership at the Wikimedia Foundation. It&#8217;s maintained by volunteers (including some WMF staff acting in a volunteer capacity). However, the amount of contributors is very low and technical debt is accumulating.</p>\n<p>Thumbor, on the other hand, is <a href=\"https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/graphs/contributors\">a very active open-source project with many contributors</a>. A large company, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Globo\">Globo</a>, where this project originated, dedicates significant resources to it.</p>\n<p>In the open source world, joining forces with others pays off, and Thumbor is the perfect example of this. Like other large websites leveraging Thumbor, we&#8217;ve contributed <a href=\"https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/commits?author=gi11es\">a number of upstream changes</a>.</p>\n<p>Maintenance of <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/THMBREXT/\">Wikimedia-specific Thumbor plugins</a> remains, but those represent only a small portion of the code, the lion&#8217;s share of the functionality being provided by Thumbor.</p>\n<h4>Service-oriented architecture</h4>\n<p>For operational purposes, running parts of the wiki workflow as isolated services is always beneficial. It enables us to set up the best fencing possible for security purposes, where Thumbor only has access to what it needs. This limits the amount of damage possible in case of a security vulnerability propagated through media files.</p>\n<p>From monitoring, to resource usage control and upstream security updates, running our media thumbnailing as a service has significant operational upsides.</p>\n<h4>New features</h4>\n<p>3rd-party open source projects might have features that would have been low priority on our list to implement, or considered too costly to build. Thumbor sports a number of features that MediaWiki currently doesn&#8217;t have, which might open exciting possibilities in the future, such as <a href=\"http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/detection_algorithms.html#facial-detection\">feature detection</a> and advanced <a href=\"http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters.html\">filters</a>.</p>\n<p>At this time, however, we&#8217;re only aiming to deploy Thumbor to Wikimedia production as a drop-in replacement for MediaWiki thumbnailing, targeting feature parity with the status quo.</p>\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n<p>Where does performance fit in all this? For one, Thumbor&#8217;s clean extension architecture means that the <a href=\"https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/THMBREXT/\">Wikimedia-specific code footprint is small</a>, making improvements to our thumbnailing pipeline a lot easier. Running thumbnailing as a service means that it should be more practical to test alternative thumbnailing software and parameters.</p>\n<p>Rendering thumbnails as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP\">WebP</a> to user agents that support it is a <a href=\"http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html?highlight=webp\">built-in feature of Thumbor</a> and the most likely first performance project we&#8217;ll leverage Thumbor for, once Thumbor has proven to handle our production load correctly for some time. This alone should save a significant amount of bandwidth for users whose user agents support WebP. This is the sort of high-impact performance change to our images that Thumbor will make a lot easier to achieve.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Those many factors contributed to us betting on Thumbor. Soon it will be put to the test of Wikimedia production where not only the scale of our traffic but also the huge diversity of media files we host make thumbnailing a challenge.</p>\n<p>In the next blog post, I&#8217;ll describe the architecture of our production thumbnailing pipeline in detail and where Thumbor fits into it.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:GDubuc_(WMF)\">Gilles Dubuc</a>, Senior Software Engineer, Performance</em><br />\n<em>Wikimedia Foundation</em></p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.wikimedia.org&#038;blog=67752302&#038;post=54359&#038;subd=wikimediablog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />","published":"2017-12-09T06:48:56.000Z","author":"Gilles Dubuc","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/09/thumbor-journey-rationale/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.wikimedia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.wikimedia.org","name":"Wikimedia Blog"}},{"title":"Camino a gvSIG 2.4: Herramienta de Información Rápida","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-07T10:53:21.000Z","author":"Óscar Martínez","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/07/camino-a-gvsig-2-4-herramienta-de-informacion-rapida/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"SIG aplicado a Gestión Municipal: Módulo 16.2 ‘gvSIG Online (Edición básica, hiperenlace…)’","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-07T09:47:52.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/07/sig-aplicado-a-gestion-municipal-modulo-16-2-gvsig-online-edicion-basica-hiperenlace/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Verslag: OSGeo.nl Dag 2017","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-06T22:17:08.000Z","author":"Just van den Broecke","link":"https://osgeo.nl/2017/12/verslag-osgeonl-dag-2017/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Data exploration with Data Plotly for QGIS3","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-06T21:57:25.000Z","author":"underdark","link":"https://anitagraser.com/2017/12/06/data-exploration-with-data-plotly-for-qgis3/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"blog:podrecznik_do_qgis","content":"","published":"2017-12-06T18:21:10.000Z","author":"robert","link":"http://quantum-gis.pl/blog/podrecznik_do_qgis","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"PostGIS \"Fund Me\" Milestone","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-06T16:00:00.000Z","author":"OSGeo Website Committee","link":"http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2017/12/postgis-fund-me.html","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Speeding up the Travis Build to Decrease the Building Time","content":"<img width=\"660\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1-768x475.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?resize=750%2C464&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1 825w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" data-attachment-id=\"12534\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/speeding-up-the-travis-build-to-decrease-the-building-time/fsat-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?fit=825%2C510&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"825,510\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fsat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?fit=750%2C464&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsat-1.png?fit=660%2C408&amp;ssl=1\" /><p><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/meilix\">Meilix</a> is the repository which uses build script to generate community version of <a href=\"http://lubuntu.net\">lubuntu</a> as LXQT Desktop.

fetched, so we included it into .travis.yml and downloaded it before entering into the chroot environment. By specifying those packages in the .travis.yml, Travis provides those packages beforehand into the docker container so it will run our script. Since the scripts also include package then when the script runs apt-get it won&#8217;t download those packages again. They are specified outside the chroot environment because they are expected to be at the system the build.sh script is run to get the iso. By this way, we get a sharp decrease in build time as the internet in the Travis CI container is not so fast so the package download time can be avoided. Now the build is taking around 15-16 minutes to build and deploy.</p>\n<p>One thing to note that we didn’t remove those packages off build.sh so that build.sh works outside Travis CI as well.</p>\n<p>References:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/meilix/pull/176\">Pull #176</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/abishekvashok\">@abishekvashok<br />\n</a><a href=\"https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/\">Speeding up Travis Build</a> by Travis CI<br />\n<a href=\"https://atchai.com/blog/faster-ci/\">Faster Build by atchai.com</a></p>\n","published":"2017-12-06T12:35:56.000Z","author":"meets2tarun","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/speeding-up-the-travis-build-to-decrease-the-building-time/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":""}},{"title":"OpenMapTiles Satellite","content":"","published":"2017-12-06T11:00:00.000Z","author":"Klokan Technologies GmbH","link":"http://feeds.klokan.cz/~r/klokan-blog-osgeo/~3/Pjy2a1Mj_KY/openmaptiles-satellite.html","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Finland 100 with 90 years of Finnish hockey","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-06T03:16:38.000Z","author":"Heikki Vesanto","link":"https://gisforthought.com/finland-100-with-90-years-of-finnish-hockey/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Material del Taller de Desarrollo Avanzado con Scripting de las 13as Jornadas gvSIG","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-05T14:44:02.000Z","author":"Óscar Martínez","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/05/material-del-taller-de-desarrollo-avanzado-con-scripting-de-las-13as-jornadas-gvsig/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Geographic Information Systems applied to Municipality Management: List of topics and 1st module, ‘Differences between GIS and CAD’","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-04T19:13:05.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/04/free-course-about-geographic-information-systems-applied-to-municipality-management-list-of-topics-and-1st-module-differences-between-sig-and-cad/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Documentation for QGIS 3.0 – call for contributions!","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-04T17:48:30.000Z","author":"Tim Sutton","link":"http://blog.qgis.org/2017/12/04/documentation-for-qgis-3-0-call-for-contributions/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Jornada gvSIG en la Universidad Miguel Hernández de Elche, con entrega de premios de la Cátedra gvSIG (13/12/2017)","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-04T16:57:03.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/04/jornada-gvsig-en-la-universidad-miguel-hernandez-de-elche-con-entrega-de-premios-de-la-catedra-gvsig-13-12-2017/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"SIG aplicado a Gestión Municipal: Módulo 16.1 ‘gvSIG Online (Publicar cartografía, edición avanzada…)’","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-04T15:13:11.000Z","author":"Mario","link":"https://blog.gvsig.org/2017/12/04/sig-aplicado-a-gestion-municipal-modulo-16-1-gvsig-online-publicar-cartografia-edicion-avanzada/","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"Developing the SCP 6: Clustering with K-means and ISODATA algorithms","content":"[object Object]","published":"2017-12-04T10:11:00.000Z","author":"Luca Congedo","link":"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/3241663152321399210/posts/default/6609380088905746778","feed":{"source":"http://planet.osgeo.org/atom.xml","name":"Planet OSGeo","link":"http://planet.osgeo.org"}},{"title":"What is Open Source and why you should do it?","content":"<img width=\"660\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fossasia2-768x396.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block;

All you can do is change the code of the software to make it better. Now, you may be thinking what’s there in for you? There are all pros according to me and I have explained them in the latter half of this article.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Why am I writing this?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was just in the freshman’s year of my college when I came to know about the web and how it works. I started my journey as a developer, building things, started doing some projects and keeping it with myself. Those days,  exploring more, I first came to know about the Open Source software.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curiously, wanting to know more about the same, I got to know that anyone can make his/her software Open so as to make it available to others for use and development. Thus, learning more about the same led me to explore other’s projects on GitHub and I went through the codebases of the softwares and started contributing. I remember my first contribution was to correct a “typo” i.e correcting a spelling mistake in the README of the project. That said, I went on exploring more and more and got my hands on Open Source which made me share some of my thoughts with you.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What’s there in for you doing Open Source Contribution?</b></h3>\n<h3><b>1) Teaches you how to structure code:</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now a days, nearly many of the software projects are Open Sourced and the community of developer works on the projects to constantly improve them. Thus, big projects have big codebases too which are really hard to understand at first but after giving some time to understand and contribute, you will be fine with those. The thing with such projects is they have a structured code, by “structured”, I mean to say there are strict guidelines for the project i.e they have good tests written which make you write the code as they want, i.e clean and readable. Thus, by writing such code, you will learn how to structure it which ultimately is a great habit that every developer should practice.</span></p>\n<h4><b>2) Team Work:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating and maintaining a large project requires team work. When you contribute to a project, you have to work in a team where you have to take others opinions, give your opinions, ask teammates for improvisations or ask anything whichever you are stuck with. Thus, working in team increases productivity, community interaction, your own network, etc.</span></p>\n<h4><b>3) Improves the developer you:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so I think, one of the most important part of your developer journey is and should be “LEARNING ALWAYS”. Thus, when you contribute, your code is reviewed by others (experts or maintainers of project) who eventually point out the mistakes or the improvisations to be done in the code so that the code can be written much cleaner than you had written. Also, you start to think a problem widely. While solving the problem, you ensure that the code you have written makes the app scalable for a large number of users, also prolonging the life of code.</span></p>\n<h4><b>4) Increases your Network:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One advantage of Open Source contribution is that it also increases your network in the developer community. Thus, you get to know about the things that you have never heard of, you get to explore them, you get to meet people, you get to know what is going in what parts of the world, etc. Having connections with other developers sitting in different countries is always a bonus.</span></p>\n<h4><b>5) Earn some bucks too:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, money matters. Earlier days, people used to think that contributing to Open Source projects won’t earn you money, etc. But if you are a maintainer or a continuous contributor of a great project, you get donations to get continuing the project and making it available to people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students in college, doing Open Source is a bonus. There are programmes like:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Summer of Code</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://outreachy.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outreachy</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rails Girls Summer of Code</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These programmes offer high incentives and stipends to the fellow students. FOSSASIA participates in GSoC so you can go ahead and try getting in GSoC under FOSSASIA.</span></p>\n<h4><b>6) Plus point for job seekers:</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to applying for job, if you have a good Open Source profile, the recruiter finds a reason to take you out and offer you an interview since you already know how to “manage a project”, “work in team”, “get work done”, “solve a problem efficiently”, etc. Now a days, many companies mention on their job application page as “Open Source would be a bonus”.</span></p>\n<p><b>7) Where can you start:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have many projects at FOSSASIA to start with. There are no restrictions on the language since we have projects available for most of the languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, we are having a couple of programs open at FOSSASIA. They are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://codeheat.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codeheat</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://codein.withgoogle.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Code-in</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel free to check out the programs and the projects under FOSSASIA at </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://github.com/fossasia</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, yeah. This was it. Hope you understood what Open Source is and how would it benefit you. Keep contributing to FOSSASIA and you will see the effects in no time.</span></p>\n","published":"2017-12-02T07:37:01.000Z","author":"sumedh123","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org/what-is-open-source-and-why-you-should-do-it/","feed":{"source":"https://blog.fossasia.org/feed/","link":"https://blog.fossasia.org","name":""}},{"title":"Enhancing Rotation in Phimp.me using Horizontal Wheel View","content":"<img width=\"626\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png?w=626&amp;ssl=1 626w, https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" data-attachment-id=\"13086\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.fossasia.org/enhancing-rotation-in-phimp-me-using-horizontal-wheel-view/hvwmain/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png?fit=626%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"626,306\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Horizontal Wheel View in Phimp.me\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png?fit=626%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/blog.fossasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HVWMain.png?fit=626%2C306&amp;ssl=1\" /><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Installation</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To implement rotation of an image in </span><a href=\"https://github.com/fossasia/phimpme-android\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phimp.me</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,  we have implemented </span><a href=\"https://github.com/shchurov/HorizontalWheelView/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Horizontal Wheel View</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> feature.

No, I don&#8217;t mean Christmas, I (obviously) mean the Classical Community Clean Up. Debussy went very well, Mahler was <a href=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/11/08/classical-clean-up-2-mahler-the-conclusions/\">fantastic</a>, and it&#8217;s time for a third!

We encourage you during this time to not only help the community clean up Dvořák’s metadata, but to learn more about <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/819eaeb2-8dd8-48a5-ad07-0bcd137985ef\">Dvořák</a> as well.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"6926\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/12/01/classical-clean-up-3-dvorak/cleanupposter-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"596,842\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cleanupposter-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=212\" data-large-file=\"https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=596\" class=\"wp-image-6926 aligncenter\" src=\"https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=368&#038;h=521\" alt=\"\" width=\"368\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=368&amp;h=521 368w, https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=68&amp;h=96 68w, https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg?w=212&amp;h=300 212w, https://musicbrainz.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/cleanupposter-01.jpg 596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>The clean up events officially last one month (but can be continued until they’re complete!) and are meant to utilize our community’s power to clean up our classical metadata. If you are new to MusicBrainz, to classical editing, or both, we have a whole <a href=\"https://community.metabrainz.org/t/the-classical-editor-toolbox/295817\">tool box</a> and plenty of advice, tips and tricks to share. We advise you bookmark the tool box—it’s quite helpful! Our team of classical music enthusiasts will also provide plenty of support <a href=\"https://community.metabrainz.org/c/musicbrainz/classical\">on our forums</a>, so come join us!</p>\n<p>What we will work on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviewing the existing works to make sure there are no duplicates and the information looks correct, and add any missing works (keep in mind while it is perfectly ok to add lost works, it’d be good to specify they’re lost so that people don’t accidentally use them on recordings).</li>\n<li>Check the <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/819eaeb2-8dd8-48a5-ad07-0bcd137985ef/releases\">release list</a> for anything that doesn’t follow the <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Classical\">classical guidelines</a>. Not only that should be fixed, but that’s a good sign of the recording and relationship info being incomplete too.</li>\n<li>Check the<a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/819eaeb2-8dd8-48a5-ad07-0bcd137985ef/recordings\"> recording list</a>. The only recordings that should be here by the end of the cleanup are of Dvořák himself as a performer (probably none, and in any case very few). Anything else being here should have performer relationships added to it if missing, then the artist credits for the recording should be changed to list the main performers (you can use the <a href=\"https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/20766-musicbrainz-replace-recording-artists-from-a-release-page\">relevant script</a> for that). Try to fix the whole release the recording is on, even if it’s not all by Dvořák! But in the case of a very large compilation, it’s always acceptable to fix only the Dvořák content on it.</li>\n<li>Add missing Dvořák recordings! If you have enough info to add a Dvořák release we’re missing, that’s always useful. Just make sure to try to add as much info as possible from the get go, so we don’t have to clean that addition up as well. <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recently had 2995 recordings, 781 works and 862 releases under Dvořák, and we&#8217;re expecting to have many fewer wrongly listed recordings and many more Dvořák releases by the end of the month. Don’t know where to begin? <a href=\"https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication\">Join us</a> and ask, let us help you find a jumping in point!

In the final session, it was touching to see the outpouring of gratitude from her colleagues and the well-deserved standing ovation from the attendees that she received. Coordinating the attendance of 329 individuals from 147 orgs from 35 countries is an immense undertaking and the smoothness and fluidity with which they pulled off the event was impressive. The entire team of Stephanie, Cat, Mary, Maria, Josh, and Robert as well as many other volunteers, worked tirelessly the whole weekend to ensure everybody’s needs were met. Thanks also for the generosity of Google for covering the travel and hotel costs for three of our mentors. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6446\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730.jpg 4608w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730-300x225.jpg 300w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730-768x576.jpg 768w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730-705x529.jpg 705w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_123730-450x338.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to our Mentors who attended</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you to Gaurav who traveled from Delhi, Pranjal who traveled from Bangalore, and Ishan who traveled from Amsterdam to attend the Mentor Summit.

When not in the unconference sessions, he was deep in brainstorming sessions with me to plan out his role on the Apache Fineract PMC and how we can put amplify his extensive knowledge and experience across the community. I’m going to now highly encourage that we allow for future attendees to be first or second-timers at the Summit so they can maximize the potential at the event.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6452\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457.jpg 3264w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457-300x225.jpg 300w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457-768x576.jpg 768w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457-705x529.jpg 705w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171015_160457-450x338.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unconference &#8211; Broadening my Horizon</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-6442 alignnone\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933.jpg 3456w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933-225x300.jpg 225w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933-529x705.jpg 529w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_101933-450x600.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-6447 alignnone\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155.jpg 3456w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155-225x300.jpg 225w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155-529x705.jpg 529w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_20171014_182155-450x600.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unconference format proved highly beneficial in terms of both growing and sharing my knowledge.

Over the years, we’ve made it a concerted effort of ours to identify, attract, retain and transform our interns into long-term contributors. Before, during, and after GSOC we’ve employed some successful strategies and tactics that I was happy to share with others including seeking out junior interns who are passionate and have full potential they’re looking to fulfill, making our interns feel like they belong to our community during GSOC, and then recognizing and empowering them with leadership roles after GSOC. The session was well-attended and well-received &#8211; notes can be found here: </span><a href=\"https://goo.gl/yofrLr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://goo.gl/yofrLr</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also attended the following sessions:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Failing More Students</strong> &#8211; while failing students is a painful yet necessary part of GSOC, I attended to share our experiences we had with failing students and to learn from others. What struck me most was how much Google encourages organizations to fail students to strengthen the integrity and prestige of a GSOC internship as well as how much they stand by and respecting mentoring organizations difficult yet necessary decisions to fail. I’ve learned that we must trust our gut intuitions and it’s better for all involved to fail earlier in the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>GCI Discussion &#8211;</strong> while we’ve participated in Google Code-In for two years, I feel we still have much to learn. I was blown away by how many students some projects were able to engaged with and the highly valuable projects that had high-schoolers work on too. The most important takeaway I had was to leverage our previous GCI and GSOC participants to do on-the-ground outreach and evangelization to local high schools.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>GSOC Selection Process</strong> &#8211; over the years, we’ve evolved our selection process and criteria to be fairly effective in identifying students who can both deliver immediate impact during the summer and stick around for the long-haul. I was happy to share how much emphasis we put on community interactions when requiring several pull requests before an application has been submitted as well as the vital importance of knowledge and alignment with our mission to show commitment to the project, as well as the technical questions during our Skype interviews as a powerful final evaluation metric.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6458\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012.jpg 5184w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012-300x200.jpg 300w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012-768x512.jpg 768w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012-705x470.jpg 705w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8012-450x300.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To amplify my technical knowledge&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>GitHub Workflow Improvements</strong> &#8211; it was neat to learn about the shared pains of so many projects with Github and eye-opening to learn about some of the valuable tools like Zulipbot, Gitmate, etc the that the opern source community has created to better automate processes and address these pain points.

This week-end was the <a href=\"http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com\">Google Summer of Code</a> mentor summit. This event gathers mentors from all organizations participating in GSoC and GCI for an event hosted by Google.</p> <p>Usually the summit happens at the same time as BeGeistert, and as a result I never made it there before. But with no BeGeistert happening this year, I could finally make it.</p> <p>Normally each organization is allowed to send 2 mentors, but we managed to get 6 people from Haiku to attend this year (by a combination of an extra mentor allowed because we do GCI, putting people on the waiting list and taking the slots freed by other orgs sending only one (or 0) mentor), having some Haiku people working at Google and helping run the event, and an hand-crafted badge to get into the event without registering)</p> <p><img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/haiku.jpg\"/> <p>Left to right: Scott McCreary, Bruno G. Albuquerque, Rene Gollent, Urias McCullough, Jessica Hamilton, Adrien Destugues</p></p> <p>This year the week-end started with a more formal than usual social event. After checking out our rooms at the hotels, we took a shuttle to the Google Tech Corners (buildings dedicated to such events) and gathered in one of the restaurants there for a welcome dinner. Then there was an opening session where the Google Open Source team introduced themselves (Cat, Chris, Stephanie, Marie, Robert, Josh and Maria, who joined the team just two months ago) and gave an outline of the plans for the week-end.</p> <p>In order to get people to know each other, we were asked to introduce ourselves in just 4 words. There were some fun and interesting choices (my personal favorite: \"Linux: kill, kill, kill!\" from a FreeBSD mentor). A \"scavenger hunt\" game was also launched where people would have to find mentors (or other people) having characteristics from a given list and trying to fill all the boxes (going from \"I don't like pizza\" to \"I jumped off a plane\").</p> <p>We then stayed for the evening in the room, meeting mentors from other orgs and enjoying some Google ice cream.</p> <p><img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/cardgame.jpg\"/> <p>Beasts vs. Babies, an interesting card game Jessicah introduced to us.</p></p> <p>I was quite tired because of the long plane trip and timezone changes (30 hours days are not manageable) so I went to sleep at a reasonable time - but not before trying to figure out how to fit all of us, plus Jessica's bike, in Bruno's car (this din't work and the bike and her owner took a shuttle bus eventually).</p> <p>The main part of the event started on saturday. The format is an \"unconference\". The idea is to get people to discuss things together and come up with new ideas or share existing ones. Rather than people reading their prepared-in-advance slides, the sessions are rather in the format of a meeting, people sit around a table and talk about a given topic. The topics are allocated by putting post-it on a large board with a list of rooms and timeslots.</p> <p><img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/chilling.jpg\"/> <p>Interestingly, the Haiku mentors often decided to attend the same sessions - except in some cases where two interesting sessions took place at the same time and we had to split the team. We of course attended the &ldquo;Non-Linux systems&rdquo; session, meeting with MacPorts, FreeBSD, QubesOS, as well as some projects interested in improving their portability (git, and some other I forgot - sorry!). There were other interesting sessions on getting contributors to stay (where for the first time I heard of an open source project which does NOT want getting new contributors), brainstorming on how to get multiple organizations to collaborate on their GSoC projects (where we had some experience with the work on SDL 2.0 some years ago), and of course the session on Google Code-In where we could answer other organization&rsquo;s questions about the contest (which we have just applied to for an 8th consecutive year)</p></p> <p><img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/stickers.jpg\"/></p> <p>Aside the sessions, there was also pleinty of space in the building to just sit down and talk with other people (or sit in front of a computer and hack, but that is really not the point of the event and there was always someone to discuss things with anyway). Some other interesting features of the event are the sticker table - where orgs can put their stickers for others to collect, and the chocolate table, where mentors try to bring the most unusual chocolate from their area. So if you are after pear or vodka flavored chocolate, this was the place to go.</p> <img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/chocolate.jpg\"/> <p>Google also had their own table where they kept adding \"swag\" over the week-end: T-Shirts, books, socks (yes, GSocks for the GSoC!), pens and notebooks, etc, for mentors to collect.</p> <img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/swag.jpg\"/> <p>In the evening, there was a \"social event\" outside with a band playing music, bonfires, drinks, etc. However I went to sleep quite early as I was very tired.</p> <p><img src=\"../files/blog/pulkomandy/GSoCMentoSummit2017/end.jpg\"/> <p>Sunday had more sessions, ending with the closing ceremony, with a prizegiving for the mentor scavenger hunt (it was tricky to win it, you had to remember to ask not only mentors, but also the Google team and even security guards if you wanted to fill it all!). Then it was already time to board the shuttles back to the airport.</p></p>","published":"2017-10-16T20:26:14.000Z","author":"pulkomandy","link":"https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/pulkomandy/2017-10-16_gsoc_summit_report/","feed":{"source":"https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/index.xml","link":"https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/","name":"Haiku Project"}},{"title":"OpenMRS September 2017 Volunteer of the Month: Ivange Larry","content":"<p><a href=\"http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ivange.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-4160 alignright\" src=\"http://openmrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ivange.jpg\" alt=\"Ivange Larry Picture\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a>OpenMRS is once again delighted to announce Ivange Larry (<a href=\"https://talk.openmrs.org/users/ivange94\">@ivange94</a>) as the September 2017 Volunteer of the Month.

I&#8217;m Ivange Larry. I&#8217;m a final year Software Engineering student from the University of Buea in Cameroon. I&#8217;m actually still a student, so still in school. Out of OpenMRS, I&#8217;m mostly in school.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf: </strong>What year of university are you in?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange: </strong>I&#8217;m in senior year.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf: </strong>What major or field of study are you in?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange: </strong>Computer Engineering, specialized in software.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> So how did you get started with OpenMRS?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> Ok so, in 2015, I attended one Google Summer of Code meetup, and after the meetup, I was so much interested in getting in Google Summer of Code. Then, I started looking for an organization. There was this one time in class I was studying, I saw an OpenMRS flyer. The flyer was kind of hard for me to see from a distance. The website was confusing, but I saw a flyer and then joined the Talk forum, which was very friendly. So I decided to start looking at the code of OpenMRS. No, I think that was in 2014. I start looking at the code. I was still a newbie in Java then, and the code was a little frightening for me. I had never done Spring, so back in 2014/15, I bought a book about Spring for Java Web Developers. I was just learning how to code in the Spring Framework. Now in 2014/15, I joined OpenMRS. I started doing small contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> So what would you say attracted you to OpenMRS over any other organization or what do you love about OpenMRS?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> First, growing up, I always wanted to be a doctor. But around secondary school, I realize that I&#8217;m not a kind of guy that likes reading a lot. I always wanted to be a doctor and be in a position where you save lives. Biology was not for me, since I didn&#8217;t like reading so much and I needed a lot of biology [to become a doctor]. So when I left secondary school, I made up my mind: I&#8217;m going to become an engineer. I don&#8217;t want to become a doctor again because of biology. But now when I saw that flyer, OpenMRS was like a medical records organization, so I could still be a programmer and still do medical related. I could still save lives, and the OpenMRS line, &#8220;Write Code, Save Lives,&#8221; I think one of the main things that pulled me towards OpenMRS. Then when I got to OpenMRS, the community was very friendly and welcoming, so I stayed.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Oh okay, so since you contribute to OpenMRS while still doing university, how exactly do you manage your time and juggle both responsibilities as well as also managing your personal life?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> First, I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;m very bad at time management, so&#8230;. When I was working with OpenMRS, I was working mostly late at night. After I came back from school, I&#8217;d have a good rest. Then, I wake up late at night, staying 3-4 hours on OpenMRS, and I sleep the next day, go to school, and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Oh, so you&#8217;re a very motivated person, that&#8217;s nice. So do you have any tips for any new or aspiring developers willing to work with OpenMRS?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> I think earlier I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions&#8221;. OpenMRS is one of the most friendly communities I&#8217;ve ever been in. OpenMRS is actually the first open-source community I have ever joined. But after I joined OpenMRS, I worked with a couple of open-source organizations, and I can say for sure that OpenMRS is one of the most welcoming organizations I&#8217;ve ever been in. So, the only advice I can ever give is to any new person joining OpenMRS is, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be ashamed to ask questions. Ask anything. Whether it&#8217;s on the IRC channel or Talk forum, you will have someone like Daniel Kayiwa (<a href=\"https://talk.openmrs.org/users/dkayiwa/activity\">@dkayiwa</a>), always there trying to help you.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Got it. So I wanted to know more about yourself. What projects or responsibilities did you take on in OpenMRS? I know that you were the helpdesk manager for a while too and worked on the Radiology Module. Would you like to expand on those?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> I got started with OpenMRS by fixing small bugs, implementing new features. Then, I got accepted into Google Summer of Code 2016 with OpenMRS where I worked on the Radiology Module. That was to enhance the reporting in the radiology module. The module could not support templates, and so radiologists had to create their report structure every time they created a report. So, my work in 2016 was to make it possible for the radiology module to support templates so that radiologists don&#8217;t have to be creating the report structure every time they needed a report. They could just use a template, and just by putting a little bit of data, they could receive their report. During that time, I was also sometimes the scrum leader. I used to lead the daily scrum, me and Shreyans (<a href=\"https://talk.openmrs.org/users/bholagabbar/activity\">@bholagabbar</a>). I was also a mentor in Google Code-In 2016. Yea, it was a great experience, and during Google Code-In, I also signed up for the helpdesk manager role. I really wanted a lot because when I got to OpenMRS, it was always about code. When I got into the community, I realized there&#8217;s so much more than just writing code. I wanted to get some leadership role so that&#8217;s why I mentored in Google Code-In. I was also on the IRC channel trying to help answer questions to newcomers the same way Daniel Kayiwa was helping me. I volunteered to be the helpdesk manager of OpenMRS.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Got it, I actually remember you as my Google Code-In mentor.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> (chuckles) Oh, that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> So what are your goals in the future and what do you plan to do or what are your aspirations?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> Umm, I&#8217;m in my final year so I should be finished with school. My goal right now consists of Software Engineering. For the past time I&#8217;ve worked, I&#8217;ve done Google Summer of Code. I&#8217;ve got to attend some conferences like right now I&#8217;m attending the Open Source Summit. I&#8217;ve realized there&#8217;s still a lot to learn. There&#8217;s a lot to learn out there. My goal right now is not even getting the job; it&#8217;s try to learn a lot of all these cool technologies and what is actually being used now. To keep up to date. There&#8217;s so much competition in tech, and my goal right now is to build my skill to beat the competition. Right now, I&#8217;m running the Java user group. With the user group I hope to learn a lot from others.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Wow, that&#8217;s very impressive!</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> I really respect the beauty of my skills. I joined a startup, and they&#8217;re working on  a really cool project which I can not say a lot about. It&#8217;s a project that makes use of things like microservices and cloud native. It&#8217;s a project where I&#8217;m really sure I&#8217;m going to learn a lot from it. After my graduation, I&#8217;ll probably spend a year or two with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Wow, I&#8217;m very impressed. I wish you the best of luck in that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Now onto some quick facts and tidbits. So what are your hobbies?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> I&#8217;m a very fun person, like a lot of programmers, but I do play basketball. I played basketball in high school. After high school, I&#8217;ve just been playing street basketball, at least once every week for exercise or fun but not something professional. I also like music, but I can&#8217;t sing. I try to play the piano.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> (chuckles) So what would you say would be your favorite movie or work of literature?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> Well, my favorite movie&#8230;. I watch a lot of good movies, but if you ask my favorite movie, I&#8217;ll say probably the one that inspired me to be a programmer: Live Free or Die Hard with Bruce Willis.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> And what about your favorite program or software to use?</p>\n<p><strong>Ivange:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s a hard one. I&#8217;ve just been coding for OpenMRS for a while so&#8230;. (laughs). Maybe my favorite software is my Idea IntelliJ. It helps me a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Yusuf:</strong> Ok, well I had a great time chatting with you Ivange and I absolutely love your contributions as a very young community member.

Here is what they had to say!</p>\n<h3><div class=\"flex_column av_one_full  flex_column_div first  \" ><p><strong>What was your most rewarding experience contributing to Mifos this summer?</strong></p></div></h3>\n<div class=\"flex_column av_one_half  flex_column_div first  \" ><p><strong>Dilpreet Singh &#8211; </strong>Interacting with mentors in meetings was the most rewarding experience for me as every time I end up learning amazing stuff, best practises and get to hear great advices. Mifos helped me improve my knowledge and I always feel great to be a part of Mifos contributing to projects which impact people’s life.</p>\n<p><b>Kumaranath </b><b>Fernando &#8211;</b> There were many rewarding experiences out of all, what I would like to highlight is mastering and writing extensible, flexible clean code.</p>\n<p><b>Mohit Bajoria &#8211;</b><b> </b>Most rewarding experience contributing to Mifos this summer was Maintaining the community app hurdles and learning from them, diving deep about progressive web app, testing on lighthouse. Other than learning, it was my mentor Maulik, Gaurav, who made the GSoC lot more fun.</p>\n<p><b>Raunak Sett &#8211;</b> Most rewarding experience for me was interacting with the community and solving problems together and learning a lot in the process.</p>\n<p><b>Rajan Maurya</b><b> &#8211; </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, thanks to my mentors, Markus Geiss and Mark van Veen; both of them helped me alot. I never waited for a response, and always got my problem resolved within couple of minutes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been contributing to Mifos from two years on and I always have a goal to write quality and efficient one-time code that will handle everything. It doesn’t matter what will change in future and If anything will break in future, that should be easily fixable. My most rewarding experience was helping GSoC students teaching them good practices and if they stuck be always ready to solve their problem</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-11.17.01-AM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6370 alignleft\" src=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-11.17.01-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-11.17.01-AM.png 317w, http://mifos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-11.17.01-AM-248x300.png 248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" /></a></p>\n<p><b><div style='padding-bottom:5px;' class='av-special-heading av-special-heading-h3  blockquote classic-quote  '><h3 class='av-special-heading-tag '  itemprop=\"headline\"  >Nikhil Pawar &#8211;</b> This GSOC, I  had an opportunity to virtually meet lots of people, both within community and outside community.

If your approach is not good then listen your mentor and try again and try hard to make thing with quality. it does not matter you have to give 2 more hours a days or you have to write code at night. Just do it and prove yourself you are good one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second: Wait for mentor review for every step, mentors are busy always give you reply on time but If you want to take review on every step then a single feature implementation will take too much time and I am sure you will not satisfied about your work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better do some research and implement own your own and tell you mentor your approach or talk to him before implementing with full plan.

I&#8217;ve used Linux on and off for well over 15+ years.</p>\n<h2><strong>When I started with OpenMRS</strong></h2>\n<p>Back in 2008 &#8211; nearly 10 years ago &#8211; time flies.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you get interested in OpenMRS</strong></h2>\n<p>I liked that the work made an impact and that it didn&#8217;t directly benefit me.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do you participate in the community<br />\n</strong></h2>\n<p>I initially joined the OpenMRS community as a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/\">Google Summer of Code</a> Student from 2008-2009 (2010 I was a student with the <a href=\"https://sahanafoundation.org/\">Sahana Software Foundation</a>). I maintained an active presence and occasionally contributed (I did a significant amount of work on the <a href=\"https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Groovy+Module\">Groovy Module</a>). After I graduated with my Bachelors in Computer Science, I started helping out with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/\">Google Code-In</a> and volunteered to help review the pull requests which revamped the ID Dashboard design. This quickly snowballed into me actively maintaining it. I&#8217;ve since made it easier for new developers to get started by dockerizing the application. This also lead me to join the Infrastructure Team (which I actually resigned from in September of 2016). I have since been helping out on and off and working on ID dashboard whenever time permitted. I still occasionally offer my input in the Infrastructure Chat on matters as I catch them.</p>\n<h2><strong>What drives or inspires you to work with OpenMRS</strong></h2>\n<p>The community.
