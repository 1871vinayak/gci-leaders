        <p>Chrys took up the role of coordinator, fixer and new master of KDE accessibility, which I think is just fantastic. We have been working on what he decided to be most important, mostly chrys fixing issues to make things work with Plasma and screen readers. After getting Orca to read desktop icons he spent quite some time to improve the various start menus.</p> <p>With so much fresh energy around I started poking at KWin, which was a bit scary, to be honest. It was fun to read code I hadn&#8217;t looked at before. In the end, after I spent a while working on a huge work-around, it turned out that we could enable the task switcher to work with relatively little code added. The main issue was that KWin does really not want to give focus to the task switcher. My first attempt was to write sub-classes of <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html">QAccessibleInterface</a> for everything in KWin. That started to work, but during some debugging I realized that KWin was actually creating the regular representations for its UI, it was just not properly announcing them to Orca. Thus I threw away my almost complete prototype. At least I verified that it&#8217;s possible to create an entire Qt UI for screen readers only, disconnected from the actual UI. Thanks to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessible.html#installFactory">QAccessible::installFactory</a> it is nowadays pretty easy to instantiate custom representations (subclasses of <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html">QAccessibleInterface</a>). Once that was done, I started over and made the task switcher think it&#8217;s an active window without letting X11 or Wayland know. That way we get the right dbus messages sent to Orca, when alt-tabbing through the windows. Thanks David, Martin, Roman and Vlad for your input <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gladhorn/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> </p> <p>More work is needed on Plasma when it comes to keyboard usability &#8211; getting the focus onto the panel and the various notification areas. I&#8217;m sure some great ideas are already being worked on, but I can see this easily as a blocker going forward. Configuring the network, checking the battery status and other tasks are really important after all.</p> <p>I wrote the basics for Kate to work with screen readers in 2014 and it seems like there are some improvements needed when working with Orca, luckily we got some help from Joanie (who maintains Orca) to figure out what goes wrong when navigating by lines. Now it&#8217;s just to verify the findings and get the issues sorted out.</p> <p>If you have a bit of time and want to help, we need someone with good English skills to help clean up the wiki. Good written instructions are really helpful when getting blind users to try Plasma for the first time. We&#8217;d also be happy if more people joined in testing and improving things. Join the <a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-accessibility">KDE Accessibility mailing list</a> to join the fun.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I had never contributed to any open source project before Fedora. I found open source intimidating &#8211; and I used to think a thousand times before sending any message on IRC. During those first few days, I used webchat to connect to IRC &#8211; simply because I didn&#8217;t know any other alternative. The internet connection I was using was also not that good and I was worried it would drop off and I would miss a message. I am not sure if I missed any messages but after a few days, Justin reached out and helped me set up my IRC bouncer. I am pretty sure I asked him stupid questions but he didn’t show it and I am glad for that! That act of empathy gave me a new found motivation to contribute to Fedora and I have continued since (even though the bouncer hasn&#8217;t!).&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://bee2502.github.io/" target="_blank">Bee Padalkar</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/2" target="_blank">contributor-stories#2</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It was year 2009 and I move from my native city to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caracas</a>.<br>I met tatica several years ago, in my college years, when I was trying to promote FLOSS in my university with my LUG and travel across the country with a national congress. She was also the photographer of my wedding.</p><p>At that time (2009) I was working with the Ubuntu Local Community and we were more focused in attend events and some installations. Once at Caracas I met with tatica to help with the organization of the FLISoL and she was the national coordinator. In that FLISoL I was representing Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu and I saw the Fedora stand, they were showing the stuff I usually do in my Ubuntu, but with Fedora, and that let me to think, I can try Fedora again (I knew Fedora Core 3 and 4 before, but I didn&#8217;t found it interesting). After FLISoL, I was a little upset and tire about the Ubuntu Community because I was wanting to do more, more than just events, more than a personal blog, more than just show the distro, but I focused in my job and I started to get away from the community, but still using Linux at a daily basis.</p><p>Getting in touch with people at Caracas and nearby areas, I&#8217;ve attended to a meeting with one of the oldest hardcore communities in Venezuela, I knew several of the guys there, including tatica, in that meeting she invited me to the FUDCon that will be held in Valencia (2012). There I notice something that I never notice before, and it wasn&#8217;t the event or the talks, It was the community itself that took my attention. There I have the chance of talk to several Ambassadors from Latam and to know how their work was actually affecting the distro, not only giving talks, but working in packaging, testing, coding, design, marketing and a lot of areas that actually helps the distro to grow, hand to hand with the community. That year I talked with tatica and told her I want to be part of this and I receive from her an advice that I still carry with me when I&#8217;m going to do something related to the community: &#8220;We are Friends, we have a Free, First and Feature distro to complete our 4 Foundations but the real gasoline that keep this engine going is the commitment. If you want to work with this awesome community be honest, be committed and be humble, that way you will gain trust in the community and things will be great both for you and for Fedora&#8221;. After that year I was going in and out of the community until 2016 when I email her and told I want to be an Ambassador. She IS my mentor, she taught me how this wheel rolls and she still give me advices in times of despair. For that and more, my contributor story is about her. Thanks so much.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/x3m" target="_blank">Eduard Lucena</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/4" target="_blank">contributor-stories#4</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I still remember that day when I mailed her. I wanted to start on something (FOSS related) but I had no proper direction on what I should do. She was a total stranger but I stalked her on several places (hope she doesn&#8217;t mind <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f47d.png" alt="👽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) and it was really inspiring to see all the work she was doing and to be honest I just found Women Open Source contributors really cool because I am so intimidated by it. But I never expected her to reply me back or provide me with so much help.</p><p>And well, she mailed me back quite promptly, giving me more direction on how to start, she introduced me to this great community and gave me leads on what are the kinds of work I could do. The reply did overwhelm me. I feel starting is the hardest part and having such a strong and warm community around you helps you grow magnificently. I can&#8217;t thank her enough on helping me to get started on this.

        <p>Today we released version 1.10 of the KDE Connect Android app. Therefore it&#8217;s time again to share what we&#8217;ve been working on.</p> <h2>Targeting Android Oreo</h2> <p>As of this month&#160;app updates uploaded to Google Play need to <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk">target Android 8</a>. This has several implications.&#160;Targeting Oreo comes with an updated Support Library, which forces us to drop support for Android 4.0 and below. According to our Google Play data this will affect approximately 400 users. We are very sorry about that, but these users won&#8217;t receive further updates. Furthermore, Android Oreo introduced some restrictions in regard to apps running in the background. In the future in order to be able to run in the background KDE Connect needs to show a persistent notification. The good news is that you can hide the notification. The (slightly) bad news is that we cannot do it by default. To hide the notification you need to long-press it and switch it off. Other notifications from KDE Connect are unaffected by this.</p> <h2>1.10 Changes</h2> <p>These are the main changes of version 1.10. Not mentioned are countless small improvements and under-the-hood changes.</p> <p>Mouse input now works with the same speed independent from the phones pixel density.</p> <p>The media controller now allows stopping playback.</p> <p>Run command supports triggering commands using kdeconnect:// URLs. Useful for integration with NFC tags and 3rd-party apps.</p> <p>The notification filter allows quickly (de-)selecting all apps.</p> <p>Several settings scatterd across the UI have been bundled into a single settings screen.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into how we handle SMS on the Android side in preparation for something huge. Stay tuned <img alt="&#55357;&#56841;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p> <h2>Other changes</h2> <p>The desktop side has improved as well since my last post.</p> <p>The windows build of KDE Connect gained support for keyboard input.</p> <p>The plasmoid gained a couple of additions. In my last update I mentioned that it is possible to run commands from there. It is now also possible to lauch the command setup from there. Furthermore it is now possible to select files to share them from there.</p> <p>The Linux Mobile App gained many visual improvements and features. It now supports sharing files and controlling the system volume.</p> <p>If you are using&#160;<a href="https://volkerkrause.eu/2018/08/19/kde-itinerary-introduction.html">Itinerary</a>&#160;you can send booking information from the PC directly to the phone via KDE Connect.</p> <p>It is now possible to send files directly from Pantheon Files (and other Elementary apps) and Thunar via KDE Connect.</p> <p>Again, there are countless other improvements that I did not explicitly mention.</p> <p>A big thanks to all people who contributed to this!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The KMyMoney development team is proud to present <a href="http://download.kde.org/stable/kmymoney/5.0.2/src/kmymoney-5.0.2.tar.xz.mirrorlist">version 5.0.2</a> of its open source Personal Finance Manager.</p> <p>Although several members of the development team had been using version 5.0.1 in production for some time, a number of bugs and regressions slipped through testing, mainly in areas and features not used by them.</p> <p>These have been reported by many of you and the development team worked hard to fix them in the meantime. The result of this effort is the new KMyMoney 5.0.2 release.</p> <p>Despite even more extensive testing than usual, we understand that some bugs may have slipped past our best efforts. If you find one of them, please forgive us, and be sure to report it, either to the <a href="mailto:kmymoney-devel@kde.org">mailing list</a> or on <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=kmymoney&amp;format=guided">bugs.kde.org</a>.</p> <p>From here, we will continue to fix reported bugs, and working to add many requested additions and enhancements, as well as further improving performance.</p> <h2>Thanks</h2> <p>Many thanks go out to KDE&#8217;s sysadmin team. Ben in particular supported us with numerous hours to get daily builds onto the <a href="https://build.kde.org">KDE CI system</a>. This even includes MS-Windows installers. Please feel free to visit our overview page of the CI builds at <a href="https://kmymoney.org/build.php">https://kmymoney.org/build.php</a>.</p> <p>Thanks also to those users who provided valuable support by sending in test files saved by earlier versions as far back as <a href="https://kmymoney.org/news.php#itemKMyMoney466released">KMyMoney 4.6.6</a>. Using these files we were able to fix some upgrade problems.</p> <h2>The details</h2> <p>Here is the list of the bugs which have been fixed:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=283784">283784</a> when using the &#8216;amount entry widget&#8217;

      <div class="content">
        <p>We continue adding support for more data formats that can be imported into LabPlot. As part of the upcoming release we add the <strong>support for JSON file and for ngspice raw file format</strong> which we want to introduce in this short blog post.</p> <p>After the selection of a <strong>JSON</strong> file in the &#8220;Import File&#8221; dialog, its content is shown in a tree view in a manner that many user will be familiar with from other JSON viewers. The relevant parts in a such a JSON file that one usually wants to visualize are arrays and objects. Once the root element that needs to be imported is selected, LabPlot automatically recognizes its type and the type of its children and generates a two dimensional preview of the data to be imported. This works the same for arrays</p> <p><center><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="JSON array" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png" width="40%" /></a> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png" title=""><img alt="Preview of JSON array" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png" width="40%" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>as well as for JSON objects<br /> <center><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="JSON object" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png" width="40%" /></a> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png" title=""><img alt="Preview of JSON object" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png" width="40%" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>After such a local file was imported, the plotting of data can be done as usual. The part that is of more practical interest, namely the import of data from online web services like stock prices, weather data, data monitoring services, etc., still needs to be implemented. Such services usually exchange the data in JSON format and the features described above can be considered as the preparational steps also in this direction. This is something for the near future.</p> <p><br /> In the previous release we made the support for live data available. To demonstrate this feature we used an <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/2018/05/16/support-for-live-data/" title="">example</a> based on the results of calculations done in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap.html" title="">Gnucap</a> &#8211; an open-source circuit simulator. The Gnucap simulation was controlled by a small PyQt GUI and the results where written out to an ASCII file which was then consumed by LabPlot (import of live data and its visualization). To further support this community, we decided to add the support for <strong>native raw format of ngspice</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/" title="">another open-source application for circuit analysis</a>. We read both flavors of it &#8211; binary and ASCII. When opening such a file, LabPlot auto-detects the ngspice raw format and selects the proper import filter.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, we use a simple circuit consisting of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET" title="">junction gate field-effect transistor</a> and of two variable voltages &#8211; gate-source and drain-source:<center><br /> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="Circuit" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png" width="50%" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>The behavior of such a transistor is usually studied with the help of its &#8220;characteristic curves&#8221; &#8211; the transfer characteristic showing the current as the function of the gain-source voltage and the output characteristic showing the current as the function of the drain-source voltage. This time the calculation is done with ngspice and we read the produced raw files with the new import filter: <center><br /> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="Transistor Characteristic Curves" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png" width="100%" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>To generate the second plot where a family of I<sub>d</sub> curves is calculated for different values of V<sub>gs</sub>, we had to implement a new feature in LabPlot to allow to only connect points that are monotonically increasing. Since all the curves in this family are put into the same data set, without this options the end points of the lines would have been connected with the origin which is not what the user wants to see for this specific data set.</p> <p>The idea for this example and the technical input around ngspice was contributed by Orestes Mas from the Technical University of Catalonia.</p>

        <p>By a strange coincidence the news broke this morning that RHEL is deprecating KDE.&#160;The real surprise here is that RHEL supported KDE all.&#160; Back in the 90s they were entirely against KDE and put lots of effort into our friendly rivals Gnome.&#160; It made some sense since at the time Qt was under a not-quite-free licence and there&#8217;s no reason why a company would want to support another company&#8217;s lock in as well as shipping incompatible licences.&#160; By the time Qt become fully free they were firmly behind Gnome.&#160; Meanwhile Rex and a team of hard working volunteers packaged it anyway and gained many users.&#160; When Red Hat was turned into the all open Fedora and the closed RHEL, Fedora was able to embrace KDE as it should but at some point the Fedora Next initiative again put KDE software in second place. Meanwhile RHEL did use Plasma 4 and hired a number of developers to help us in our time of need which was fabulous but all except one have left some time ago and nobody expected it to continue for long.</p> <p>So the deprecation is not really new or news and being picked up by the news is poor timing for Red Hat, it&#8217;s unclear if they want some distraction from the IBM news or just The Register playing around.&#160; The community has always been much better at supporting out software for their users, maybe now the community run EPEL archive can include modern Plasma 5 instead of being stuck on the much poorer previous release.</p> <p>Plasma 5 is now lightweight and feature full.&#160; We get new users and people rediscovering us every day who report it as the most usable and pleasant way to run their day.&#160; From my recent trip in Barcelona I can see how a range of different users from university to schools to government consider Plasma 5 the best way to support a large user base.&#160; We now ship on high end devices such as the KDE Slimbook down to the low spec value device of Pinebook.&#160; Our software leads the field in many areas such as video editor Kdenlive, or painting app Krita or educational suite GCompris.&#160; Our range of projects is wider than ever before with textbook project WikiToLearn allowing new ways to learn and we ship our own software through KDE Windows, Flatpak builds and KDE neon with Debs, Snaps and Docker images.</p> <p>It is a pity that RHEL users won&#8217;t be there to enjoy it by default. But, then again, they never really were. KDE is collaborative, open, privacy aware and with a vast scope of interesting projects after 22 years we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and fun.</p> <a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;t=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE&#038;s=100&#038;p&#091;url&#093;=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;p&#091;images&#093;&#091;0&#093;=&#038;p&#091;title&#093;=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" target="_blank" title="Share on Facebook"><img alt="Facebook" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" height="48" src="https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/facebook.png" style="display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;" title="Share on Facebook" width="48" /></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;text=Jonathan%20Riddell%27s%20Diary" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><img alt="twitter" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" height="48" src="https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/twitter.png" style="display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;" title="Share on Twitter" width="48" /></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-google_plus nolightbox" href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" target="_blank" title="Share on Google+"><img alt="google_plus" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" height="48" src="https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/google_plus.png" style="display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;" title="Share on Google+" width="48" /></a><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F02%2Fred-hat-and-kde%2F&#038;title=Red%20Hat%20and%20KDE" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 5px;" target="_blank" title="Share on Linkedin"><img alt="linkedin" class="synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-share" height="48" src="https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/social/regular/96x96/linkedin.png" style="display: inline; width: 48px; height: 48px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;" title="Share on Linkedin" width="48" /></a><a class="synved-social-credit" href="http://synved.com/wordpress-social-media-feather/" rel="nofollow" style="color: #444; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8px; margin-left: 5px; vertical-align: 10px; white-space: nowrap;" target="_blank" title="WordPress Social Media Feather"><span>by </span><img alt="feather" height="16" src="https://jriddell.org/wp-content/plugins/social-media-feather/synved-social/image/icon.png" style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 16px; height: 16px;" width="16" /></a>

      <h5>2018-11-02T10:00:24.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Freso</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the things various people have asked MusicBrainz for time and time again has been genres. However, genres are <em>hard</em> to do right and they&#8217;re very much subjective—with MusicBrainz dealing almost exclusively with objective data. It&#8217;s been a recurring discussion on almost all of <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit">our summits</a>, but a couple years ago (with some help from our friend Alastair Porter and his research colleagues at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">UPF</a>), we finally came to a path forward—and recently Nicolás Tamargo (reosarevok) finally turned that path forward into code… which has now been released! You can see it in action on e.g., <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e">Nine Inch Nails’ Year Zero release group</a>.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For now genres are <em>exactly the same as <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Folksonomy_Tagging">(folksonomy) tags</a></em> behind the scenes; some tags simply have become the chosen ones and are listed and presented as genres. The list of which tags are considered as genres is currently <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/entities.json#L666">hardcoded</a>, and no doubt it is missing a lot of our users&#8217; favourite genres. We plan to expand the genre list based on your requests, so if you find a genre that is missing from it, request it by <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10032&amp;issuetype=2&amp;summary=Enter%20the%20genre%20name%20here!">adding a style ticket</a> with the &#8220;Genres&#8221; component.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, genres are very subjective, so just like with folksonomy tags, you can upvote and downvote genres you agree or disagree with on any given entity, and you can also submit genre(s) for the entity that no one has added yet.</p>
<h3>What about the API?</h3>
<p>A bunch of the people asking for genres in MusicBrainz have been <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Enabled_Applications">application developers</a>, and this type of people are usually more interested in how to actually extract the genres from our data.</p>
<p>The method to request genres mirrors that of tags: you can use <code>inc=genres</code> to get all the genres everyone has proposed for the entity, or <code>inc=user-genres</code> to get all the genres you have proposed yourself (or both!). For the same release group as before, you&#8217;d want <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres</code></a> for the XML API and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json</code></a> for the JSON API.</p>
<p>Since genres are tags, all the genres will continue to be served with <code>inc=tags</code> as before as well. As such, you can always use the tag endpoint if you would rather filter the tags by your own genre list rather than follow the MusicBrainz one, or if you want to also get other non-genre tags (maybe you want moods, or maybe you&#8217;re really interested in finding artists who perform hip hop music <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/tag/death%20by%20murder">were murdered</a> – we won&#8217;t stop you!).</p>
<h4>I use the database directly, not the API</h4>
<p>You can parse the <code>tag</code>→<code>genres</code> from <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/raw/master/entities.json"><code>entities.json</code> in the root of the &#8220;musicbrainz-server&#8221; repository</a> which will give you a list of what we currently consider genres. Then you can simply compare any folksonomy tags from the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema#tag_table.2C_.26_the_.2A_tag_and_tag_raw_tables"><code>%_tag</code> tables</a>.</p>
<h4>Note about licensing</h4>
<p>One thing to keep in mind for any data consumers out there is that, as per our <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/Data_License">data licensing</a>, tags—and thus also genres—are not part of our &#8220;core (CC0-licensed) data&#8221;, but rather part of our &#8220;supplementary data&#8221; which is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-<strong>NonCommercial</strong> license</a>. Thus, if you wish to use our genre data for something commercial, you should get a commercial use license from the <a href="https://metabrainz.org/">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>. (Of course, if you&#8217;re going to provide a commercial product using data from MusicBrainz, you should always sign up as a <a href="https://metabrainz.org/supporters">supporter</a> regardless. :)).</p>
<h3>The future?</h3>
<p>We are hoping to get a better coverage of genres (especially genres outside of the Western tradition, of which we have a very small amount right now) with your help! That applies both to expanding the genre list and actually applying genres to entities. For the latter, remember that everyone can downvote your genre suggestion if they don&#8217;t agree, so don&#8217;t think too much about &#8220;what genres does the world think apply to this artist/release/whatever&#8221;. Just add what <strong>you</strong> feel is right; if everyone does that we&#8217;ll get much better information. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In the near future we&#8217;re hoping to move the genre list from the code to the database (which shouldn&#8217;t mean too much for most of you, other than less waiting between a new genre being proposed for the list and it being added, but is much better for future development). Also planned is a way to indicate that several tags are the same genre (so that if you tag something as &#8220;hiphop&#8221;, &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; the system will understand that&#8217;s really all the same). Further down the line, who knows! We might eventually make genres into limited entities of a sort, in order to allow linking to, say, the appropriate Wikidata/Wikipedia pages. We might do some fun stuff. Time will tell!</p>

        <p>At the KDE booth at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/">Embedded Linux Conference Europe</a> in Edinburgh the other week you might have seen the Plasma Mobile shell running on a Raspberry Pi 3, similar to what I <a href="https://conf.kde.org/en/Akademy2018/public/events/23">presented at Akademy</a> in Vienna. Besides showing the flexibility of Plasma and how nicely the <a href="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/">Plasma Mobile</a> shell works on touch screens, this was originally built as a demonstration of the <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/index.html">KDE Frameworks 5</a> <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto</a> recipes.</p> <h3 id="background">Background</h3> <p>Making KF5 easily available to users of Yocto is actually a rather old idea, and considering how popular Qt and Yocto are for user interfaces in embedded systems that makes a lot of sense. Johan Thelin <a href="https://www.thelins.se/johan/blog/2014/07/kf5-in-yocto/">started the work on this</a> in 2014. Things went dormant for a while until this was revived during <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2017">Akademy in Almer&#237;a</a> last year. By now we have 74 of the 79 KF5 frameworks available in the <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/source/yocto-meta-kf5/">meta-kf5</a> layer.</p> <p>With the KDE Frameworks being mostly libraries, it&#8217;s somewhat hard to test and demonstrate their capabilities though. So, we added another Yocto layer, <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/source/yocto-meta-kde/">meta-kde</a>, which contains recipes for the Plasma parts needed for bringing up a basic Plasma Mobile shell.</p> <h3 id="status">Status</h3> <p>With the monthly release cycle of KF5, sustainable maintenance has been a key focus. Besides automating the recipe updates as much as possible, getting rid of all patches against KF5 has been a priority. With 5.48.0 we finally achieved that, the KF5 Yocto recipes now use entirely unpatched upstream code. That might seem somewhat obvious, but is far from common in the Yocto world unfortunately.</p> <p>A frequent reason for needing patches (and also the reason for the majority of KF5 patches resulting from this) is fixing cross-compilation issues. While cross-compilation works reasonably well out of the box for simple libraries, things get a bit more interesting when custom code generation tools get involved (example fixes: <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D7102">syntax-highlighting</a>, <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D6990">Sonnet</a>).</p> <p>The Yocto build however is now continuously verifying that cross-compilation works for KF5, which other platforms needing this benefit from as well, like Android.</p> <h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3> <p>There is more to do of course, as the <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/241/">Phabricator workboard</a> shows. This is an interesting playground if you want to understand, explore and tweak every little detail of a Linux-based system, e.g. for minimizing boot time or image size of a Plasma Mobile system.</p> <p>In case you just want to try Plasma Mobile or do application development for it, there are probably easier ways forward though, Yocto is known to have a rather steep learning curve, which is the price you pay for its flexibility.</p> <p>If you are interested in KF5 on Yocto or have questions about this, join us on the <a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-embedded">kde-embedded mailing list</a>.</p>

        <p>Last month the X.Org Developer&#8217;s Conference (XDC) was held in A Coru&#241;a, Spain. I took part as a Plasma/KWin developer. My main goal was to simply get into contact with developers from other projects and companies working on open source technology in order to show them that the KDE community aims at being a reliable partner to them now and in the future.</p> <p>Instead of recounting chronologically what went down at the conference let us look at three key groups of attendees, who are relevant to KWin and Plasma: the graphics drivers and kernel developers, upstream userland and colleagues working on other compositor projects.</p> <h3 id="graphics-drivers-and-kernel">Graphics drivers and kernel</h3> <p>If you search on Youtube for videos of talks from previous XDC conferences or for the videos from this year&#8217;s XDC you will notice that there are many talks by graphics drivers developers, often directly employed by hardware vendors.</p> <p>The reason is that hardware vendors have enough money to employ open source developers and send them to conferences and that they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XHZd4uXRI&amp;t=16m20s">benefit greatly</a> from contributing directly to open source projects. Something which also Nvidia management will realize at some point.</p> <p>On the other side I talked to the Nvidia engineers at the conference, who were very friendly and eager to converse about their technical solutions which they are allowed to share with the community. Sadly their primarily usage of proprietary technology in general hinders them in taking a more active role in the community and there is apparently no progress on their proposed open standard Wayland buffer sharing API.</p> <p>At least we arranged that they would send some hardware for testing purposes. I won&#8217;t be the recipient, since my work focus will be on other topics in the immediate future, but I was able to point to another KWin contributor, who should receive some Nvidia hardware in the future so he can better troubleshoot problems our users on Nvidia experience.</p> <p>The situation looks completely different for Intel and AMD. In particular Intel has a longstanding track record of open development of their own drivers and contributing to generic open source solutions also being supported by other vendors. And AMD decided not too long ago to open source their most commonly used graphics drivers on Linux. In both cases it is a bliss to target their latest hardware and it was as great as I imagined it to be talking to their developers at XDC, because they are not only interested in their own products but in boosting the whole ecosystem and finding suitable solutions for everyone. I want to explicitly mention Martin Peres from Intel and Harry Wentland from AMD, who I had long, interesting discussions with and who showed great interest in improving the collaboration of low-level engineers and us in userland.</p> <p>Who I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet is ARM. Although they are just like Nvidia, Intel and AMD an XDC &#8220;Gold Sponsor&#8221; their contribution in terms of content to the conference was minimal, most likely for the same reason of being mostly closed source as in the Nvidia case. And that is equally sad, since we do have some interest in making ARM a well supported target for Plasma. An example is Plasma on the <a href="https://twitter.com/thepine64/status/1057379204021583872">Pinebook</a>. But the driver situation for ARM Mali GPUs is just ugly, developing for them is torture. I know because I did some of the integration work for the Pinebook. All the more I respect the efforts by several extremely talented hackers to provide open-source drivers for ARM Mali GPUs. Some of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtt2Y7XZS3k">presented</a> their work at XDC.</p> <h3 id="xorg-and-freedesktoporg-upstream">X.Org and freedesktop.org upstream</h3> <p>Linux graphics drivers are cool and all, but without XServer, Wayland and other auxiliary cross-vendor user space libraries there would be not much to show off to the user. And after all it is the <em>X.Org</em> Developer&#8217;s conference, most notably being home to the XServer and maybe in the future <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2018-October/039533.html">governance wise</a> also to freedesktop.org. So after looking at low-level driver development, what role did these projects and their developers play at the conference?</p> <p>First I have to say, that the dichotomy established in the previous paragraph is of course not that distinct. Several graphics drivers are part of mesa, which is again part of freedesktop.org and many graphics drivers developers are also contributing to user land or involved in organizational aspects of X.Org and freedesktop.org. A more prominent one of these organizational aspects is hosting of projects. There was a presentation by Daniel Stone about the freedesktop.org transition to GitLab, what was a rather huge project this year and is still ongoing.</p> <p>But regarding technical topics there were not many presentations about XServer, Wayland and other high level components. After seeing some lightning talks on the first day of the conference I decided to hold a lightning talk myself about my Xwayland GSOC project in 2017. I got one of the last slots on Friday and you can watch a video of my presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjs_Yoz5n_c">here</a>. Also Drew De Vault presented a demo of wlroot&#8217;s layer shell.</p> <p>So there were not so many talks about the higher level user space graphics stack, but some of us plan to increase the ratio of such talks in the future. After talking about graphics drivers developers and upstream userland this brings me directly to the last group of people:</p> <h3 id="compositors-developers">Compositors developers</h3> <p>We were somewhat a special crowd at XDC. From distinct projects, some of us were from wlroots, Guido from Purism and me from KWin, we were united in, to my knowledge, all of us being the first time at XDC.</p> <p>If you look at past conferences the involvement of compositor developers was marginal. My proclaimed goal and I believe also the one of all the others is to change this from now on. Because from embedded to desktop we will all benefit by working together where possible and exchanging information with each other, with upstream and with hardware vendors. I believe X.Org and freedesktop.org can be a perfect platform for that.</p> <h3 id="final-remarks-on-organisation">Final remarks on organisation</h3> <p>The organisation of the conference was simply great. Huge thanks to igalia for hosting XDC in their beautiful home town.</p> <p>What I really liked about the conference schedule was that there were always three long breaks every day and long pauses between the talks allowing the attendees to talk to each other.</p> <p>What I didn&#8217;t like about the conference was that all the attendees were spread over the city in different hotels. I do like the KDE Akademy approach better in this regard: everyone in one place so you can drink together a last beer at the hotel bar before going to bed. That said there were events at multiple evenings throughout the week, but recommending a reasonable priced default hotel for everyone not being part of a large group might still be an idea for next XDC.</p>

        <p>It&#8217;s been a while since I posted anything related to the Akonadi EWS resource, but that does not mean that the project is abandoned &#8211; development is ongoing, albeit a little slow.</p> <p>Today&#8217;s episode of &#8220;what&#8217;s going on in the EWS world&#8221; is all about authentication.</p> <p>From the early days of Akonadi EWS interacting with Microsoft authentication mechanisms was a bit on the hard side. Anybody who is wondering why is invited to look into Samba history &amp; development, which should be a good enough indication of the problems we&#8217;re dealing with here. This mostly impacted NTLM authentication, which had to be patched in KIO in order to work properly (NTLM version 2).</p> <h2>OAuth2</h2> <p>With the move to the cloud and introduction of Office 365 Microsoft went into more modern authentication methods. One of them is OAuth2, which was already widely used in other services, such as GMail.</p> <p>One specific thing about OAuth2 is that you need to register an application, for which authentication is taking place. In case of Office 365 this means an Azure account is needed to register an application.</p> <p>Evolution, which has been supporting OAuth2 chose to let the user to provide its own registered application, which effectively means that the OAuth2 authentication backend is non-functional out-of-the-box. User interaction is needed in order to enable it.</p> <p>For Akonadi EWS I chose to register my own app, which means that OAuth2 should be working without any further user actions beside supplying a password.</p> <p>The application registration should be working for everyone as it was registered as a global app. It is however possible that an administrator of a corporate Office 365 account may either explicitly block it or use a whitelist of apps that have access to Exchange. Should this ever happen a back door is left behind in the EWS Resource &#8211; similar to Evolution it is possible to configure a different app identifier to be used instead of the default. This can be done by manually editing the <strong>~/.config/akonadi_ews_resource_?rc</strong>&#160;file (? will be a number starting from 0) and adding a new line:</p> <pre>OAuth2AppId=&lt;app-uuid&gt;</pre> <p>In case of very stubborn admins, the ultimate way to work around obstacles is to use the app id from Microsoft Outlook (d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c).</p> <h2>Strong authentication</h2> <p>Experienced sysadmins have already noticed that using just a username and password for authentication is proving to be not sufficient. For that purpose additional authentication steps, such as MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) have been deployed.</p> <p>Another option is to establish some form of trust against the device that is used for authentication, which ensures that access from a company owned or managed device is considered safe.</p> <p>For the latter purpose Microsoft defined an additional authentication protocol called Public Key Authentication Protocol&#160;(PKey) described in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt223996.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[MS-PKAP]</a>. It is used during OAuth2 authentication to prove possession of a device-specific private key. This key is being generated and registered with the Azure Directory during device enrolment into the corporate directory. This can be done by performing a Workplace Join from Windows 10 or using the InTune app on Android.</p> <p>From what I can find it looks like Akonadi EWS is the first open-source implementation of the PKey authentication protocol.</p> <p>Why is this so important? Depending on the security policy defined by the corporate administrator it may have decided to block access to Office 365 from outside the company network for unregistered devices or alternatively require additional authentication steps (MFA) when connecting from outside the office. By setting up Private key authentication it is possible to be seen as trusted in the same way as Windows users.</p> <p>So far there are no open-source tools to register such a certificate/private key with the Azure Directory. Fortunately however the protocol has been published and I will be working on such a tool/script.</p> <p>Both OAuth2 and Public/Private Key Authentication are implemented and will hopefully be part of KDE Applications 18.12 release.</p> <h2>What&#8217;s next on the table</h2> <h3>SAML</h3> <p>I&#8217;m not done with authentication yet. There is one more authentication goodie in the pipeline.</p> <p>While OAuth2 is a nice and generic solution it brings a slight drawback &#8211; you need to type your password and/or MFA token every two weeks or so.</p> <p>For Office 365 and Azure Directory users there is however another way in &#8211; based on ADFS SAML authentication. This method is non-interactive and can be used with just the username/email and password. There is a catch however &#8211; if the administrator has chosen to require strong authentication when connecting outside of trusted network this method will not work unless it is used together with PKey authentication.</p> <h3>EWS SOAP API refactoring</h3> <p>In the current implementation all EWS SOAP requests have been written manually. They are in many ways copies of each other with lots of boilerplate code.</p> <p>The plan is for this to be replaced by generated code.</p> <p>This is a significant task to do, however when it&#8217;s done it will open up possibilities for the long awaited full calendar support and more.</p>

        <p>Hullo!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working on a system to import listens automatically to ListenBrainz from Spotify and we&#8217;ve recently deployed it to <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org">the ListenBrainz beta site</a>. We would really appreciate it if you could help us test it out!</p>
<p>Please note that this is still beta software, there is a (very small) chance that we might miss a listen or two. So if you&#8217;re using this, please make sure that ListenBrainz is not the only service where you&#8217;re archiving your listens.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that importing the same listens from two different sources such as Last.FM and Spotify may cause the creation of duplicates in your listen history. If you opt into our automatic Spotify import, please do not use the Last.FM import or submit listens from other ListenBrainz clients. This is a temporary limitation while we find better ways to deduplicate listens.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for the caveats, please go ahead and use the new shiny <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org/profile/connect-spotify">Spotify Importer</a>. And feel free to report bugs on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org">tickets.metabrainz.org</a> or <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">on IRC</a> in #metabrainz on Freenode.</p>

        <p><!-- # My participation at Krita October Sprint --><br /> A few weeks ago I travelled to the Netherlands to be part of the Krita October Sprint. During this Sprint we decided to focus on bug fixing, my tasks included some simple bugs and a couple of more convoluted bugs. I started fixing the simple ones in order to gain speed: one about modifiers not working on OSX, the bug was simple enough but puzzling as the missing logic shouldn&#8217;t make the code work on Linux, but it did. The second bug was related to events logic in the preferences dialog command: My first approach was good but not simple, so talking with the team made me change the solution to something much more simple.</p> <figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1672" style="width: 600px;"><a href="https://colorathis.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/dvy7984sm.jpeg"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1672" src="https://colorathis.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/dvy7984sm.jpeg?w=809" /></a>Hard working Krita Sprinters</figure> <p>The next days showed me how deep the rabbit hole goes in Krita&#8217;s code, my bug was in the invert color code, some color spaces didn&#8217;t show the correct/expected result. A quick dive showed that there was a different codebase for every colorspace invert operation, and the wrong results showed for the missing implementations. However this made the solution not very portable as the combination of colorspaces and color depths suggested I needed to implement 18 color inverters. A short consultation showed me that there was a space invert operation already implemented for the pixel depth, so refactoring to use this convertors in one class to invert the input colors made the invert filter work as expected, except for CMYK and Lab spaces in 16bit float spaces. After a couple of days of digging into the code and testing, we found that there is a a bug in the way CMYK and Lab is values are processed as normalized values are not returned in places they should be.</p> <p>As my first Krita Sprint I was very nervous, however I was even more exited to meet the team. In a way it was also the first time to work in a code only environment which made it very fruitful as it showed me that code is not made by super coding super geniuses, but by a little changes made by a coordinated team of normal people.</p>

        <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is honored to join the <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/about-gni/">Global Network Initiative</a> (GNI) as an observer, an opportunity we hope will advance our efforts to champion freedom of expression and privacy for the Wikimedia community and beyond. GNI is a channel for collective action, advocating to governments and international institutions for policies and laws which promote free expression and privacy. As an observer to GNI, the Wikimedia Foundation will be able to benefit from this accomplished network of human rights defenders, and apply the insights we gain to our existing worldwide efforts to advance these two fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Principle to the Wikimedia movement is the idea of collaboration. Our projects are continually expanded and improved by a global community of volunteers, and we rely on donations from millions of people worldwide to continue operating year after year. Thus, when the opportunity arose to join GNI and collaborate with other leaders in both technology and digital rights, it was only natural for the Wikimedia Foundation to engage. Everyone who joins GNI, from large technology companies to civil society groups fighting for human rights online, has indicated their commitment to addressing and solving the most prescient issues in <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/">GNI’s focus areas</a>. By working with other member organizations and companies to further the rights of internet users worldwide, our participation as an observer in GNI will be just one of many ways we give back to the global community who supports the Wikimedia movement.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation understands that the protection and <a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/">promotion of human rights online</a> is essential to what we do. In order to provide access to knowledge for everyone, we must protect freedom of expression on our projects. In practice, this means we work to keep Wikipedia volunteers free from attempts to <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/22/a-letter-to-minister-ahmet-arslan/">block</a> or censor their writing on Wikipedia or requests to <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/20/wikimedia-releases-ninth-transparency-report/">remove their content</a>. We hope that by participating in GNI, we can share our experiences not only as a large internet platform, but as a mission-driven organization that holds our values firm even in the face of threats. In return, we are sure that the insights we will gain from the combined experience of GNI’s members will help us to better our initiatives to promote free expression for our communities.</p>
<p>In addition to freedom of expression, GNI and its members believe in respecting user privacy rights, including initiatives to increase <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/surveillance/">transparency and accountability in government surveillance</a>. We believe that strong privacy rules and opposition to surveillance are a fundamental part of the freedom that allows people to read and contribute to Wikipedia.  The Wikimedia Foundation has taken a clear stance defending our users’ right to privacy by taking part in a<a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/"> lawsuit challenging the NSA’s upstream surveillance collection</a> activities and encrypting all traffic to and from Wikimedia projects through the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/">HTTPS protocol</a>. By taking concrete steps to defend user privacy, we are able to offer a unique perspective to other GNI members interested in how to better protect individuals. We hope that the connections we make within GNI will strengthen our own efforts to ensure that people are free to read and write Wikipedia without fear of anyone looking over their shoulder.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation reflects our commitment to GNI’s mission in both our actions as the host of Wikipedia and our greater advocacy efforts through the Wikimedia movement. We are excited to collaborate with and learn from the variety of committed organizations and individuals who make up GNI in order to further these efforts to promote freedom of expression and privacy worldwide and ensure that everyone, everywhere can have access to knowledge.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-29T16:00:53.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Ben Vershbow and Sandra Fauconnier</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation asked designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Oates">George Oates</a>, who has worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">Flickr</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library">Open Library</a>, among others, to conduct a deep dive into <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the free media repository that provides many of the images used on Wikipedia. We wanted a fresh pair of eyeballs, and we were particularly interested in Oates’ observations about possible areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Oates soon realized navigating Wikimedia Commons and finding interesting materials is challenging. She noted how the category system used to organize and tag media files on Commons is confusing and hides—not shows—the richness of content there. Other areas of improvement she mentioned include making both contributors and contributions more prominent and inviting, improving the user experience for new users, and actively recruiting more diverse gender participation in the project. (Oates noted that the group of administrators on Wikimedia Commons is internationally diverse, but not so much in terms of gender; this affects, for instance, the selection of featured images.)</p>
<p>Oates also identified several ways in which Wikimedia Commons can work more fruitfully with GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). This is partially due to her background in the field: over the last decade, she as worked on a series of projects that have reimagined how the world engages with the collections of libraries, archives, and museums on the web.</p>
<p>She created <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">the Commons on Flickr,</a> which to this day stands as one of the most popular shared platforms for the world’s visual archives. She worked with the Internet Archive to lead the Open Library, a universal and openly editable catalog of the world’s books, connected to a digital lending library. More recently, she has worked with a variety of individual institutions to devise new ways of exploring their collections, like this experimental <a href="http://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org/">interface</a> to the Wellcome Library collection in the UK.</p>
<p>As we contemplate the future of cultural partnerships and the sharing of open collections in the Wikimedia movement, the Foundation asked George to do a short assignment: look at Wikimedia Commons through the lens of your background and experience, tell us candidly what you see, and suggest areas for improvement. We asked her to focus on the experience of new users, of cultural institutions, and to share with us some ideas of how Commons might evolve in the years ahead. Ben Vershbow (Director of Community Programs) and Sandra Fauconnier (Program Officer for GLAM and Structured Data) sat down with George to speak with her about her findings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Please tell us about yourself!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> I’ve <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeoates">worked</a> on the web since 1996, mostly in design-centered roles. I designed a lot of the user interface of the photosharing service, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, for the first few years, wrote its <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> (with Heather Champ), and particularly enjoyed creating the privacy and safety tools that helped people coexist. Since 2008, I’ve specialised in the cultural heritage sector, and today, I’m based in London, building an edtech company called <a href="http://www.museuminabox.org/">Museum in a Box</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: What were your first impressions of Wikimedia Commons, looking at it as a &#8216;well-informed newbie&#8217; and with your background of having worked on Flickr, and Flickr Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p>Turns out, Commons is huge, dense, variegated, and alive.</p>
<p>It’s a system that’s about the size of Hong Kong (7.3 million people), but it’s only about 14 years old. Hong Kong has been settled for centuries. Just like the city, Commons is full of nooks and crannies, mazes, rules, signs, and people doing their thing.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4671557223/">map of Hong Kong</a> drawn using locations where photos were taken. “Blue pictures are by locals. Red pictures are by tourists. Yellow pictures might be by either.”</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59316"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59316 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4671557223_c7c11f6d3d_b.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For me, this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157624209158632">Locals and Tourists</a> project symbolises the way people move around software systems. Software can be learned like a place. You can move around it how you see fit, and inhabit corners you like. You can see other people in it, and follow, copy, like, ignore, and meet them.</p>
<p>This sort of socialising and movement happens on Commons too, but there’s an important difference between Commons, and, say, Facebook, and that’s that <em>the locals are building the city</em>. The ‘old school’ admins know the back alleys and the best noodles, and the Commons newbies head for the tourist hotspots.</p>
<p>So, in terms of my first impressions, I faced three primary challenges to get to a position where I could present ideas, not just observe:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a newbie to the platform, unfamiliar with its rules, rituals and traditions</li>
<li>There’s a major usability challenge: Information vs Interface</li>
<li>The rules of engagement are not clear</li>
</ol>
<p>But, it also feels important to say that <strong><em>maybe there’s nothing wrong with it</em></strong>. The question in itself reveals a quiet tension. The Wikimedia Foundation’s team who support the Commons is in a hard, interesting position. They’re a crew of professional, philosophically aligned staff who find it difficult to help improve Commons. They meet resistance from the old guard, the community of volunteer admins and other long-term Commons folk who are there every day, have probably been there longer than anyone who works at the Foundation, feel deep ownership of the system, and can exercise deep control. They’ve patiently and visibly negotiated the dynamics of the system for the last fourteen years.</p>
<p>So, the question becomes <em>what is it OK for the Wikimedia Foundation to do</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Yes, you’ve put your finger on a very delicate aspect of our work. Fortunately, we are finding ways to channel great ideas from the community into well-defined efforts to improve the platform. The prime example right now is our work to integrate Commons more tightly with Wikidata to improve discovery and to offer contributors and partners better ways of describing and organizing content (see </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2017/01/09/sloan-foundation-structured-data/"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data"><em>here</em></a><em>). </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Before we go deeper into your impressions of Commons, can you say a few words about your design philosophy and how you applied it during this assignment?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>There are two main themes in my work that come to bear here:</p>
<p><strong><em>Challenging the dominance of search as primary digital cultural interface</em></strong></p>
<p>Many of the web projects I’ve made recently focus on explorability of gigantic cultural collections. I use the prompt “what happens if there’s no search box?” to help you find things. How can you show the shape and contour of a collection to allow people to follow their nose and sniff out the things that interest them?</p>
<p><strong><em>Importance of copywriting in interface design</em></strong></p>
<p>Wiki systems are always a battle of <strong>Information vs Interface</strong>. The more functional pages you need to use the thing also take the time to explain and define themselves. It can be so <em>informative</em> it’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>Wikis are also written by many. At Flickr, I wrote a lot of the interface copy; the “system voice” was largely mine, and therefore, consistent. On Commons, you don’t know who is telling you what. This opacity can be confusing if you’re expected to follow certain rules, but don’t know who’s setting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: So what did you learn as you delved deeper into Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>It’s huge and arcane. And successful. “Anyone can contribute” means that all sorts do, and there are now about 50 million things there. That’s astonishing.</p>
<p>But, there’s very little sense of the scale or depth of the thing. It’s one thing to say there are all those things that anyone can use, but it’s another to show them all. Newbie explorers are confronted with a vast textual category system including an obscure interface element to show contents of each category… can you tell what it means?</p>

<p><strong><em>Categories are a beautiful disaster</em></strong></p>
<p>The various Wikipedias work so beautifully because they embrace the networked nature of information. Pages are stronger (and accepted) when they interconnect across the system. Wikipedians joke about getting “lost down the rabbit hole”, where you’re at one place at one minute then you look up an hour later and you’re somewhere completely different. This is because all of the entries are deliberately and delicately interconnected.</p>
<p>Commons is not like that. Even though there are about 6 million “<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data/About/FAQ">multi-hierarchichal</a>” categories, the majority of files are only in one category, as this 2017 research shows:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">

<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59318"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59318 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SDoC_baseline_-_Number_of_files_by_number_of_categories.png?w=1000" alt="" width="1000" height="600" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you select <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images">Images</a> at the top of the homepage, you see a list of categories of <em>types</em> of image, not <em>types of things</em> in images. That’s tricky if you’re looking for a photo of a flower and not <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_resolution">Images by Resolution</a>. There are also Topics on the homepage, which operate a little more like you’d expect. You can click on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, then explore <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chirality_in_mathematics">Chirality in Mathematics</a> or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sets_of_mathematical_objects">Sets of Mathematical Objects</a>. I was able to find what might be the best category in the history of categories though: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Potato_truncated_from_cube_to_predicate_lattice">Potato truncated from cube to predicate lattice</a>. <strong>Does that sound like a category to you?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Showing the actors</strong></em></p>
<p>I was surprised the thousands of people participating aren’t more obvious. Who’s editing what? Which people like which categories? Who is uploading a lot? Who’s helping other people? I became interested in who the admins were, how/when rules were established, and how decisions are made. If we think in terms of locals and tourists, who are the actors who know what’s happening, who I could ask for advice, or imitate?</p>
<p><em><strong>Encouraging description</strong></em></p>

</div>
<p>When you get to a media file, like this fabulous <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_approach_of_the_spirits%22.png">The approach of the spirits</a>, there’s nowhere to jump across to; no way to see images like the one you’ve just discovered. Its categories are listed as <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PD-Art_(PD-US-1923)">PD-Art (PD-US-1923)</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations">Illustrations</a>. Nothing like <em>myth</em>, <em>stories</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>spirits</em>, <em>stars</em>, or <em>the night sky</em>.</p>
<p>Not being able to move sideways is a huge weakness of any hierarchical structure. It can also be difficult to navigate a hierarchy unless you know its whole structure. You’re constantly going into a branch then back out again, instead of skipping across an interconnected collection. That said, the new work on interconnected Commons infoboxes looks really promising, e.g. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Paul%27s_Cathedral">Category:St. Paul’s Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no limit to how many categories a digital object could belong to. How could the system be improved to allow more and different descriptions? As with many traditional cultural collections, an object’s metadata is revisited rarely, so instead of a live database of media like Flickr, where objects enjoy a very social existence, a thinly described object in a sea of 50 million is practically invisible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rules of engagement</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At the start of my wiki-journey, I was left to fend for myself. It felt akin to being surrounded by hungry beasts and wondering why you&#8217;re still alive&#8230;” –</em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pyfan">Pyfan</a></p>
<p>While it’s also easy or almost trite to say that Wikis are transparent democracies where anyone can participate, I also read quite a lot that people feel really intimidated when they first “come to the party”.  The category structure might also have evolved into what’s there today because the rules of engagement are dense, and the interface when you try to add or enhance things is obtuse.</p>
<p>As I did my research, I asked a few questions in the IRC channel, or on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump">Village Pump</a> (which is really well run, by the way). Answers would be presented, and be useful, but, they referenced pages that I bet would have taken me forever to find, if I could find them at all. They often displayed old “votes” or decisions made by a very few, and not revisited, or with no recourse to revisit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any tips and direct feedback for the Wikimedia Commons community?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s <em>amazing</em>!!</p>
<p>Like I said, I remain interested in the administration of the thing. In this self-governing system, how are rules created? How do those rules percolate to the newbies? How visible are they? And most importantly, who is making them?</p>
<p>There are about 225 admins for 7.2 million accounts on Commons. It’s a media library built by 7 million, but not all are editing and adding things all the time. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation suggests about <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/#/commons.wikimedia.org/contributing/editors/normal%7Cline%7C2-Year%7C~total">32,000 folks a month</a> are active, but even so, the system is administered by just 0.00003% of the population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diversity in administration / representation / arbitration</em></strong></p>
<p>I looked into who the Commons admins are, with the data to hand.[1] Here’s a graph that shows <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">how many admins were brought on each year</a>, and how many from each year “survived” as admins.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59320"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59320 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Added-and-surviving-admins.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="630" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I also looked at each admin’s page, and noted whenever I could see a declared gender (using names or photos etc). Here’s the breakdown of admin community demographics:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59322"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59322 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Admin-community-demographics.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="312" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>The geographical and language spread of the admins seems pretty good. There are people from different countries, who often also participate in their language Wikipedia and/or the EN Wikipedia, and sometimes even work for, or have worked for, the Foundation. But, even in a best case scenario (where the “unspecified” category from the pie chart was actually about 50/50 women and men, that would still be 66% men and 33% women as declared administrators. There also aren’t many new folks. This might be because the rules of engagement take a while to take in and operate at a sophisticated level. Perhaps it’s also a place to inject diversity, particularly around the things that require some kind of vote or consensus.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note at this point that Hong Kong has a police force of 34,000.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fostering diversity</em></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://seejane.org/about-us/">Geena Davis Research Institute</a> was founded in 2004 to study and shift the balance of representation of women and girls in media. Their tagline is “<em>if she can see it, she can be it</em>,” and the institute has done groundbreaking research about how to measure the presence of women and men in films, mostly, to demonstrate the presence of unconscious bias in our media. The stats are telling.</p>
<p>One of the very simple ways the institute suggests to check when you’re making a movie is that all the crowd scenes contain 50/50 women and men. I really like this. It’s easy to check and simple to do. If we apply this idea to Commons, one place to look for an “equal crowd” is the various Highlights areas, like Photo of the Day, or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Meet_our_photographers">Meet our photographers</a>. Today, those lists are mostly of men, and even some of the older admins.</p>
<p>Those public lists are a place to look for fostering more diverse representation in the community. How could the procedure for creating those lists be realigned with a positive and welcomed diversity agenda?</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing precedents</em></strong></p>
<p>During my research, I was shocked to see a photograph of a naked woman show up on the homepage of Commons, marked as Photo of the Day. I went to the Help Desk to ask “Why is OK to have a picture of a nude woman on the homepage?” I wasn’t crying OMG P0RN!, but suggesting that the image may be an alienating first image for some to encounter. It’s worth <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&amp;oldid=305803393#Why_is_it_OK_to_have_a_picture_of_a_nude_woman_on_the_home_page?">having a read</a> (and a mark of the strength of a wiki’s nature that I can retrieve the conversation). For me, it was telling that the rebuttals to my query ranged from tired responses around “pornography or art”, or that “galleries are full of naked women”, to more more resigned responses like “it’s already been decided”, or, “But this is the Internet, where the opinions of Western young men dominate, so good luck getting any sort of grown-up discussion about that.”</p>
<p>The fact that there the system is full of old decisions that are no longer questioned is a problem. You can see how it’s now handed out as a “it’s the way we’ve always done it” response here, as another helpful person <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Village_pump&amp;oldid=305254391#Objection_to_placement_of_non-notable_naked_recumbent_woman_on_homepage_today">chipped in with support for my query</a>. You can also <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_picture_candidates/File:Fine-art-nudesunpine.jpg">see the original voting process in action, in November 2013</a>, which pushed the photo of the naked woman into the picture of the day category. (Warning: you’ll also see the naked woman on that page.) Of the 18 votes cast, at least 17 of them were by men, 3 of whom were admins, many of whom have been on Commons 5+ years, and a handful of whom are also featured photographers.</p>
<p>I realise that this file and its life on Commons may be an easy target, but, it’s also indicative of the oligarchal participation and representation on Commons.</p>
<p>What if featured photographs votes require a more representative voter group? What if you, as a user, could only have 10 featured photographs? What if the “Featured” lists were removed entirely?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the design of Wikimedia Commons in general, to make it easier to use?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>If we’re talking about making it easier to use for individuals using the web interface, then yes, I do.</p>
<p>There are just five user pages and one email in the UI that could be improved to help new folks get grounded. Making them crisp and instructional instead of information vs interface would have a huge effect. It’s about decluttering the copy and trying to help the new person figure out what to do first. The pages are <strong>User</strong>, (and <strong>welcome email</strong>), <strong>User talk</strong>, <strong>Watchlist</strong>, <strong>User contributions</strong>, and <strong>File list</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the current Welcome email, the first point of contact from the Commons to an individual:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi there [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons! Someone (probably you) from IP address 51.148.133.195, has registered an account “[Username]” with your email address here. We’re glad you decided to join us.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>What next? First you should confirm your account.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>To confirm that this account really does belong to you and activate email features on Wikimedia Commons, open this link in your browser:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>After that, you’ll see ideas on how to get started and links to help you learn about Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>From all of us here at Wikimedia Commons, welcome aboard!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>If you did *not* register the account, follow this link to cancel the email address confirmation:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>This confirmation code will expire at 13:53, 13 June 2018.</em></p>
<p>This asks more questions than it answers, and even casts doubt on me being a legitimate user! “Someone (probably you) / “to confirm this account really does belong to you…” come across as defensive and doubtful. Hardly a friendly welcome for someone new.</p>
<p>Have a look at the difference if you make it more concise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons, the world’s free media library!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Your first step is to confirm your email address, please:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Once that’s done, there are a few ways we recommend getting started:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>• Read the Policies and Guidelines of contributing to Wikimedia Commons<br />
</em><em>• Take a Photo Challenge or Upload your first media file<br />
</em><em>• Help improve information about Commons resources<br />
</em><em>• Have a look around your account settings</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Good luck! And if you get stuck, please visit the Community Help Centre.</em></p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that I have absolutely no idea how I—an interested interface designer—could independently contribute effort towards making this part of the system better, just like I can edit regular entries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Seeing each other</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the reasons I think Flickr and other social systems are so successful is because we can <em>see each other </em>when we use them. They show people their own stuff, other people’s stuff, allow them to follow/connect/gather, show the activity happening—<em>particularly on your stuff because we all love that</em>—and often, give a short list of things to try next, to show the way through. We learn from the way other people act and operate in the physical world, and that’s the same on a software platform.</p>
<p>The foundation is there on Commons to enhance representations of scale, activity, and actors to help people see each other more clearly. Improving those five core screens with these themes in mind would help locate new people in the system, and give them only as much information as they need, when they need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: And what about suggestions on how to invite more and better contributions to Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would try to make it much more obvious that viewers can improve metadata; provide much clearer calls to action to interested people. I mean, it’s somewhat implied, given that it’s a Wikimedia system, but, as far as I can tell, the call to action to improve the metadata about a file is a small Edit link next to the Summary heading on the item’s page.</p>
<p>Here’s the Pied-winged swallow, Picture of the Day on 3 September:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59358" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-piper-box.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="207" /></div>
</div>
<p>If you have the gumption to click “Edit”, you get this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59326" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-swallow-2.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="293" /></p>
<p>So, even if you wanted to add information about the image &#8212; e.g. it’s taken outside, there’s blue sky, it’s a bird, etc &#8212; you have to figure out the editing code/pseudo code and its UI. I tried to add “tag=bird” for example, and it threw an error. It’s very different from having a UI designed specifically to encourage contributions and conversation. It’s not simple. (I realise that “special” images, like Picture of the Day, have protected edit capacity to prevent vandalism.)</p>
<p>There’s a ton of uploading that happens to Commons that&#8217;s not through the UI, but with lots of other tools written to streamline the process. (That’s another strength of the system, and was at Flickr for that matter—that people can contribute to it through all sorts of interfaces.) I found myself wondering if another way to improve contributions to Commons might be to focus on the connective tissue between the various Wikimedia platforms, in the UI. If I upload an image to Commons, I could be actively prompted to create or enhance a Wikipedia page…</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have suggestions on how to make Wikimedia Commons a more interesting and useful platform for external organizations (e.g. GLAMs) to work with our communities and make their knowledge available?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would look at three main areas around usefulness for institutions:</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>Demonstrating use of collections, especially in a digital context, is especially difficult for institutions. If their stuff is nestled cosily amongst about 50 million other things, how and when can they know if the effort they’ve put in to sharing their treasures in the Commons is effective? Can any use of materials be reported on? Can that be established as new, legitimate usage of an institution’s materials? How can it be more refined, or indeed, more accurate than the mysterious “page view”. How can Commons help institutions (and individuals) see when their stuff is used? Something like the old school <a href="https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/21/2008-dopplr-per.html">Dopplr Annual Report</a>, perhaps?</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation and presence</strong></em></p>
<p>As I understand it, institutions either create a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_in_the_Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">category</a> or use <a href="http://zone47.com/crotos/?p195=2817221">a totally different system</a> to see all their media in one place. Can it provide a good destination for institutions to share around? What could their “User” page be like?</p>
<p>If you look at the Wikipedia page for a contributing institution, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum">Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, you see this little box at the bottom:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59327" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nationalmuseum-Stockholm-box.png?w=246" alt="" width="246" height="67" /></p>
<p>Even just rephrasing that to say “Explore the Nationalmuseum Stockholm’s 2,400 contributions to Wikimedia Commons” or perhaps creating another box that does that might be a start. That link also takes me to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">Category:Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, but it’s not immediately clear which items are from the collection versus about the institution.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a question about whether institutions should be treated differently in the Commons context. I’m not sure about that. Perhaps it would be better to look for a way to enhance anyone’s presence equally. If part of the claimed benefit of participating in Commons is that metadata may be improved, visibility into the material also needs to be improved. What about a link on the home page to a list that shows all of the institutions?</p>
<p><em><strong>Supporting people doing great stuff</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was doing research, I attended a Wiki-a-thon at the Wellcome Collection in London. It was a day dedicated to improving the presence of women involved in medicine on Wikipedia. There were about eight people in the room, including the Wellcome Wikimedian in Residence, Alice. It was brilliant, and I could not have created my article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Stone">Clara Stone</a> without Alice in the room. The simple act of having a living human who could explain the rules and secret doors (like, you need to make 10 edits before you can make a page) instantly made the whole process more approachable.</p>
<p>Human Wikimedian presence in cultural institutions can really help bridge the gap that’s sometimes perceived between authority and the crowd, which can be difficult for institutions to conquer on their own. This mediation is hugely valuable, and something that the Foundation could continue to support directly, and more. What if there was a Wikimedian in Residence at every national library in the world? (And lots of the smaller ones too?!?)</p>
<p>I was also surprised to discover that lots of the updates to Commons are done en masse, through scripts and other programmes developed by volunteers. What sorts of other support could the Foundation provide for these folks? How can it support this developer community even more than it does now? What new efforts and resources can be amplified to reach more potential users (both outside and within GLAMs)?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Any last thoughts on what a community-driven media repository like Wikimedia Commons could become in the future?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I was a bit surprised that this work turned out to be about representation in the end. Yes, there are simple interface changes that could be made to continue to improve usability, but there’s a huge challenge for Commons (and other huge collections online like Europeana and DPLA) to improve description of their millions of things so they’re easier to see.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">just seen in the United States</a>, oligarchies don’t like change and giving up control, but what if <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385">diversity trumps ability</a>?</p>
<p>These vast online collections will eventually see a return of the power and delicacy of curation. Only machines can consume 50 million things, and even then they might not be sure exactly what those things are, and if they find something interesting they won’t know who to tell. Computers “<a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/discovery/homo-faber">scan everything and hear nothing</a>,” so we need all kinds of humans from all over the world to help gather our histories into meaningful units, but right now, Commons is a pretty closed system.</p>
<p>Imagine if Commons could become like one of the great old cities of the world, full of all kinds of people from all kinds of places instead of a big city run by a tiny group of people who basically look the same?</p>

<p>[1] The admin data consists of two views: (1) The list on the right side of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators">Commons:Administrators</a> page, and (2) those users listed on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful requests for adminship</a>, which I edited manually to separate users who’d ever been admins from those who remain admins.

I decided (2) is the more useful, but it should be stated that that’s a manually maintained list, and possibly not accurate.</p>

I&#8217;ve been creating comics and artwork for most of my life, though I didn&#8217;t seriously start making comics until several years ago. I&#8217;ve also worked variously as a writer, editor, layout artist, concert promoter, and art gallery director, among other things.</p> <h3>Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3> <p>At this point in time it&#8217;s mostly something I do for enjoyment, though I occasionally create artwork for someone else. I&#8217;d love to make comics my career, but so far that possibility hasn&#8217;t presented itself.</p> <h3>What genre(s) do you work in?</h3> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8685" height="377" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Doll.png" width="800" /></p> <p>I mostly create comic art in the science fiction and/or horror genres, often with a lot of humor in it. My style ranges a bit. While I sometimes enjoy working in a colorful painterly manner, lately I&#8217;ve been happier working in grayscale with mostly flat colors. I find it less distracting. It allows me to focus on linework, which I feel is my strongest point. Sometimes color just gets in the way. I also really like how grayscale looks.</p> <h3>Whose work inspires you most &#8212; who are your role models as an artist?</h3> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Hernandez">Jaime Hernandez</a> has probably inspired me more than any other comic artist. His work in <a href="http://www.fantagraphics.com/series/loveandrockets/">Love and Rockets</a> strongly influenced both my design and my storytelling. <a href="https://www.baldwinpage.com/">Christopher Baldwin</a> (Spacetrawler, Anna Galactic) has also been a big inspiration. His science fiction comics prompted me to start making my own. Aaron Diaz (<a href="http://dresdencodak.com/">Dresden Codak</a>) and John Allison (<a href="http://www.scarygoround.com/">Scary Go Round</a>, Bad Machinery) have also been influential to a degree. And I certainly can&#8217;t leave out fellow Krita user <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/static7/author">David Revoy</a>. His tutorials helped me learn Krita and shaped how I approach digital art.</p> <h3>How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3> <p>When I decided to make comics again in 2011, I initially went the more traditional path of ink and paper, but I quickly saw the advantages of going fully digital, so I bought an Intuos tablet and started learning, using Gimp and Inkscape. I actually got quite good in Inkscape, and most of my earliest digital work was done in it.</p> <h3>What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8687" height="660" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jane_landing.png" width="764" /></p> <p>As a comics artist, digital wins hands down over traditional methods. Being able to rearrange things in a panel and quickly change dialogue makes life much easier, especially for me, as I&#8217;m always fiddling with things.</p> <h3>How did you find out about Krita?</h3> <p>I took a short break from comics a few years ago, and when I finally decided to start back at it again, I looked around to see if anything new was available other than Gimp and Inkscape. Being a Linux user, my choices are limited in the area of digital painting programs, and I was surprised to learn about Krita. It seemed like a good alternative, so I gave it a try. This was during the 2.x versions. I was pleasantly surprised and decided to stick with it.</p> <h3>What was your first impression?</h3> <p>The first thing that made me love Krita was its focus on drawing and painting, unlike Gimp, which tries to be everything for everyone. The fact that Krita was tailored for what I wanted to do made it more pleasant to work with once I learned how to use it. I always seemed to be fighting Gimp or Inkscape, and Krita felt very friendly in contrast.</p> <h3><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8684" height="344" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Aztecs.png" width="800" /></h3> <h3>What do you love about Krita?</h3> <p>So many things! Especially with the 4.x branch. One of the most important new features for me, though, has been sessions, as I work on multiple pages at a time. Before sessions, I used to keep Krita open for days at a time just so I wouldn&#8217;t have to reopen and reposition everything each time I started it. It all happens automatically now, and that&#8217;s really saved me some time.</p> <h3>What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3> <p>I&#8217;d really like to see text improved. I&#8217;m appreciative of the complexity required in adding custom built vector capabilities to Krita, but the promised text functionality that was announced a few years ago lacks a lot of polish. Even using it for short bits of text, like signs or sound effects, can end up being frustrating, and it&#8217;s not useful for dialogue at all, or at least not for the way that I work, as there&#8217;s no wrap-around flow. I still use Inkscape for text.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3> <p>At the moment, I don&#8217;t really use any other tools for drawing. I use Inkscape and GIMP for various other art related tasks, though, and neither of them are as easy to work with as Krita. Inkscape seems quite buggy, and GIMP just doesn&#8217;t have the project management abilities that Krita does.</p> <h3>If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8686" height="665" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jane_and_Alice.png" width="800" /></p> <p>If I had to choose one panel, it would probably be the panel from Jane Smith, Inc. where all four of the primary characters appear together for the first time. I really like the composition. Each character&#8217;s personality is on full display, and you can easily see their relationship to each other in their words, expressions and body language.</p> <h3>What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3> <p>For flat grayscale work, I keep things very simple. I usually work on an entire chapter or scene at once, so I storyboard the pages first in Krita using a blue pencil and text files created in Inkscape. I then do rough sketches of each panel with a custom pencil, and once I&#8217;m happy with how everything is falling together, I go back and clean up the rough sketches.</p> <p>I use two different brushes to ink: a 12px brush for panel borders and a 5px brush for everything else. I like to hand-ink as much as possible, to give more of an alt-comics feel, rather than using svg for frames and balloons. I also do most of my detail work in the inking phase. All inking is done in two layers: a layer for the frames, and one for everything inside.</p> <p>For coloring, I mostly use the fill tool and a couple of custom brushes &#8212; one large brush for places that need hand coloring and one for detail work. Again, keeping it simple, coloring is all done in one layer.</p> <h3>Where can people see more of your work?</h3> <p>I post comics on my website at <a href="https://autumnlansing.com/comics">https://autumnlansing.com/comics</a>. I&#8217;m working on a couple of different projects at the moment, and I put up new pages from time to time. I don&#8217;t keep to any schedule. I consider myself a traditional comics artist and not a web comics creator. My work isn&#8217;t designed to be read one page at a time, so I only post when I complete scenes or chapters.</p> <h3>Anything else you&#8217;d like to share?</h3> <p>I&#8217;d like to encourage any comics artist who hasn&#8217;t tried Krita to do so. You might be pleasantly surprised at what you find. It&#8217;s very possible to make good quality comics with Krita. Don&#8217;t let the fact that it&#8217;s FOSS scare you away. And I&#8217;d also like to thank the Krita dev team for putting up with all my weird bug reports over the years! You guys do a great job.</p>

        <p>The Qt Company has been supporting three different build systems for Qt programs. For Qt users, qmake is currently the most widely used build system. CMake is a clear second and growing in popularity. The third place is Qbs, with significantly smaller adoption. When asked about their preferences, most of our customers said they plan to use either CMake or qmake in the future.</p> <p>We have decided to deprecate Qbs and redirect our resources to increase support for CMake. Qbs will remain supported until the end of 2019 with the last planned release in April 2019, together with Qt Creator 4.9. Qbs is available under both commercial and open-source licenses, and we are happy to continue providing the infrastructure for further development by the Qt Project community.</p> <p>To summarize the key points:</p> <ul> <li>Qbs will continue to be supported until end of 2019</li> <li>Last Qbs release will come out in April 2019</li> <li>Qbs continues to work with upcoming Qt Creator 4.8 and Qt Creator 4.9</li> <li>Qbs library and tools will be available under Qt Project for possible further development by the community</li> <li>Support for qmake will continue unaffected</li> <li>Support for CMake will improve</li> <li>Longer term, we plan to switch to CMake for building Qt itself</li> <li>CMake support in Qt Creator will be further improved</li> </ul> <p>Deprecating Qbs allows us to significantly improve CMake support. We believe this change will help the growing number of our customers who prefer to use the CMake build system. Beneficial is also CMake&#8217;s wide adoption outside Qt and its active development ecosystem.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/10/29/deprecation-of-qbs/" rel="nofollow">Deprecation of Qbs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blog.qt.io" rel="nofollow">Qt Blog</a>.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Gosh, you just blink and the month is over, eh.Let&#8217;s do an info-dump.</p> <h2>FreeBSD bits</h2> <p>FreeBSD ports contain Qt 5.11.2 (except for WebEngine), KDE Frameworks 5.51, KDE Plasma 5.12.7 (LTS, but there&#8217;s movement lower in the graphics stack that should allow us to update to the current feature release soon-ish), and Applications 18.08. I just updated deskutils/latte-dock to the <a href="https://psifidotos.blogspot.com/2018/10/latte-bug-fix-release-v082.html">latest 0.8.2 release</a>. Tobias has been doing <strong>everything</strong>, updating stuff all over.</p> <p>There are also things going away from FreeBSD ports. I&#8217;ll repeat for the hard-of-understanding: KDE4 ports are being removed on december 31st, 2018. We&#8217;ve notified those maintainers that we can &#8212; people using BitBounce deserve a special place and haven&#8217;t been informed, although we tried. New is that <strong>Qt4 ports are deprecated on FreeBSD</strong> and scheduled for removal on <strong>march 31st, 2019</strong> (three months after KDE4, the main consumer, is removed). This is a bigger deprecation step, actually, since it touches applications maintained outside of kde@. The issue is simple though: Qt4 went EOL in 2015 and maintainence is increasing (e.g. for OpenSSL 1.1.1, changing C++ compilers, etc.). We have started updating default flavors (for things that have both) and informing maintainers.</p> <h2>KDE bits</h2> <p><a href="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/edi.jpg"><img alt="Photo of Edinburgh from Calton Hill " class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1987" height="225" src="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/edi-300x225.jpg" width="300" /></a>I went to Edinburgh to staff the KDE booth at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/">Embedded Linux Conference</a>, along with Jon and Paul. I helped make lots of soup on the weekend and it was delicious. And then I spent three days from 8am to 6pm standing and talking to the 2000-or-so attendees of that conference.</p> <p>It was exhausting, but worth it. Mostly the message is the same: Plasma has had lots of performance work done (for the Pinebook, among other things) and so Plasma runs on a whole range of devices, from this 2GB-ram low-power ARM64 board, to, over there, the 22-core Power 9 workstation. If you thought KDE was bloated (you mean KDE4, and last looked nearly 10 years ago, right? right) then here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done for <strong>you</strong>: come back and try it again.</p> <p>KDE was one of only two &#8220;community&#8221; booths. The other was from <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/">Code Your Future</a>, which is a coding school to give refugees new skills. When you spend three whole days at a booth, you hear the &#8220;pitches&#8221; around you a lot of times, so by the end of the second day I could do a pretty keen presentation for them as well. On the other side was a stand from&#160;<a href="https://www.toganlabs.com/">Tog&#225;n Labs</a>, who do Yocto-based board bring-up and stuff .. not immediately our cup of tea, but I did end up talking about late-80s Canadian jazz bands with one of their developers. It&#8217;s a small-ish world.</p> <p>At the end of the row was the stand from the <a href="https://openpowerfoundation.org/">OpenPower Foundation</a>, with a demonstration Power9-based workstations. That&#8217;s a whole different ballgame from the low-end ARM boards, and seeing 32 hardware threads (at least, I think it was a 2-CPU times 8-core times 2-threads setup) running is pretty keen. The machine arrived with KDE Trinity installed, which .. well, I was wearing my KDE4 launch event T-shirt on tuesday and lets say that KDE3 looks even more dated than a ten-year-old conference shirt.</p> <p>Rasterman beat me to it, and the machine was quickly running a gorgeous Enlightenment environment all with fancy bubbling backgrounds and other stuff that would drive me mad quite quickly. But pretty. There is Debian installed on it, so a brief chat with the people at the stand allowed us to install Plasma 5 Desktop (<code>apt install</code> whatever..) to check that it works nicely. And it does! The performance work done really does pay off up and down the stack.</p> <h2>Calamares Bits</h2> <p>The next <a href="https://calamares.io/calamares-3.2.3-delayed/">Calamares release, 3.2.3, is delayed</a>. That is at least partly due to events-preparation and general futzing-about. I was intending to get it done this week, but I can tell already that that&#8217;s not going to happen: there was an issue reported just today that definitely needs attention. So it looks like after-the-next-event, mid-november, is a good bet for that release.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/elc-openiot-europe-2018/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ELCE 2018</a> has been a key event each of my 3 years at <a href="http://www.codethink.co.uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codethink</a>. It is an interesting conference from the technical and business point of view. This year the event was collocated again with several others, like the Open Source Summit Europe (OSS EU). It took place in Edinburgh, UK, I city I find particularly beautiful and enjoyable.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cip-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CIP</a>, the Linux Foundation Initiative for Civil Infrastructure, has the event as a key milestone. The group organises a booth and a face to face meeting of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) the day before the event starts. So for me ELCE is a day longer. The other main task for me at this event is supporting Codethink business development and community engagement actions, since I represent the company at the Linux Foundation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">During the CIP TSC face to face meeting, I did a short presentation of one of the projects I am putting effort on lately: <a href="https://buildstream.build/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BuildStream</a>. I also described the project among several people I know during the event, asking them to try out the integration tool and provide me feedback. The tool has matured quite a lot the last few months and I am interested in collecting feedback from experienced developers and software integrators.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Use04MfL2ms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lukas Bulwahn</a> is leading an interesting effort to create a safety Linux related initiative at the Linux Foundation, including a <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe-2018/program/co-located-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Safety Critical Systems</a> track at the event. I attended the last day of the conference to these talks. My colleagues Ben Dooks, senior kernel developer and Codehtink&#8217;s CEO Paul Sherwood, presented there a couple of topics we have been working on lately. I found the track interesting and learnt a few things. I hope such track consolidates and more automotive companies participate in the future.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Codethink sponsored the event and had a booth to recruit new developers. I backed up my colleague Tim a couple of times during the first two days of the event which allowed me to talk to a couple of of potential hires. It is always interesting to find out what motivates others about the company your are working for.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">During the second day of the event I took some time to visit some booths and learn about what other companies are doing, as well as attending to a couple of talks. I also had several interesting meetings and conversations with old friends and former colleagues, visited again the Edinburgh Castle, this time at night, and managed to try a few whiskies from the Highlands. Not everything was to be work, right?</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://kernelci.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kernelci.org</a> is an initiative I feel attached to since it was born during my time as Director at Linaro, promoted by engineers from my department, specially <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinhilman/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kevin Hilman</a>. Time has demonstrated that the project has helped the Linux Kernel tremendously. I hope kernelci.org get a successful second life under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Akademy 2018</a> a group of <a href="http://www.kde.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KDE</a> people agreed to put effort in showcasing KDE software at embedded events to demonstrate that Plasma Mobile is a credible option as HMI for automotive R&amp;D environments. At ELCE 2018, we showed Plasma Mobile and a couple of applications on top of a YOCTO based system on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a 7&#8243; touchscreen. Showing the same technologies across different form factors (a <a href="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mobile</a>, a <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2018/08/22/kde-plasma-arm-laptop-pinebook" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pinebook</a>, a laptop with openSUSE and the mentioned RPi3) was impressive. Sadly my RPi3 worked only the first day because it burned. I guess I have taken it to too many events. RIP my dear&#8230;.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to highlight how excited I got when I saw the KDE booth at this event, the fantastic work that Adrian, Jonathan, Kenny and Paul did there and the significant impact KDE had. Getting out of the comfort zone is never easy, but usually worth it. I am looking forward to show further progress at FOSDEM and the Embedded World early in 2019.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Except surprises, this will be the last event of the year for me. It is time to prepare next year&#8217;s agenda. I will see you all at FOSDEM 2019. Thanks <a href="http://www.codethink.co.uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codethink</a> for sponsoring my participation at ELCE 2018.</p>

        <p>Hey look, there have been 42 of these <a href="https://community.kde.org/Goals/Usability_%26_Productivity">Usability &amp; Productivity</a> posts. This week there&#8217;s a lot of in-progress work I&#8217;m tracking or working on myself that didn&#8217;t quite make it, but what I can report on is hopefully no disappointment! See for yourself:</p> <h2>New Features</h2> <ul> <li>Implemented screen reader support for desktop icons, <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D16309">so visually impaired users can now read the icons on the desktop</a> (Christian Hempfling, KDE Plasma 5.12.8). This is important work and we&#8217;re very interested in mentoring anyone else who has experience with or interest in accessibility work.

The new multi-screen approach from v0.8.1 helped me to track with a user a very annoying bug that could be present from v0.6.x era. During startup under multi-screen environments there were some rare cases that docks in explicit screens were not positioned correctly. More specific the docks were appearing in the middle of the screen or at a wrong screen rather than the appropriate screen and edge choice. The second important multi-screen bug that was fixed is that when the user was unplugging very often its external screens the associated docks were not loaded automatically when he was re-attaching that screens. So as you see v0.8.2 is a very important milestone for multi-screen environments and as such I advice you to update in case you are using multi screens.</div><span style="font-family: Aka-Acid-TypoGrotesk;"><b><i><u><br /></u></i></b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Aka-Acid-TypoGrotesk;"><b><i><u></u></i></b></span> <span style="font-family: Aka-Acid-TypoGrotesk;"><b>Complete Changelog:<i><u><br /></u></i></b></span></div><ul><li style="text-align: left;">wrong placement of docks during startup for multi-screen environments</li><li style="text-align: left;">show explicit docks automatically when their corresponding screen is added in a multi-screen environment</li><li style="text-align: left;">open files properly when dropping them on launchers</li><li style="text-align: left;">dont hide previews when hovering player buttons</li><li style="text-align: left;">update delete icons to plasma design</li><li style="text-align: left;">improve behavior according to Fitt's Law when shrinking panel margins </li><li style="text-align: left;"> dont break BorderlessMaximized window default value</li></ul>

        <p>Every year, the <a href="https://www.dotrust.org/">Digital Opportunity Trust</a> (DOT) hosts the Unconference &#8211; a participant-led event that convenes young social innovators hailing from several of the organization’s network countries. The Unconference grants youths the opportunity to connect with professionals, mentors, and one another, bringing over 100 individuals from several countries to share their innovation experiences. From Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Indigenous Canada, DOT works with governments, the private sector and community-based organizations to support youth striving to transform their societies as social innovators, digital ambassadors, and leaders.</p>
<p>This year, the conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya and centered around the theme of inclusivity &#8211; specifically, closing the gender gap in technology. The first morning plenary session was opened by DOT CEO and founder, Janet Longmore, who spoke on the rise of social entrepreneurship, innovation and business. “Think about how you can contribute in the world of humanity, because the challenge we face cannot be solved with one or two individuals,” Longmore said. “A way to truly create an inclusive world is through passion, skill, and talent of social innovators.”</p>
<p>And passionate, talented social innovators we met! DIAL had the privilege to learn about several individuals and their journeys to create and apply digital solutions to achieve positive social change in their communities. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelChatina">Emmanuel Chatina</a> has developed a social enterprise that leverages mobile phones to offer remote healthcare to those who would otherwise not have ready access to health providers.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356904" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Others are addressing the invisible form of health and seek to destigmatize dialogue surrounding it. Eunice Njeghe, Angela Mumbi, Walder Amani, and Latifa Noor promote mental health and connect individuals in Kenya to mental health providers through their mobile application, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeingPsych">PsychBeing</a>, while Yvonne Osagie from Ottawa is currently developing an online platform devoted to education, support, and prevention of sexual abuse on college campuses.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356951" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356989" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>And digital technologies are not only being used, but taught: in addition to training young girls and women in the latest technologies, Ivy Barley, co-founder of <a href="https://developersinvogue.org/">Developers in Vogue</a>, helps them navigate the tech space and connects them to real-time projects and jobs, doing her part in closing the gender divide in tech.</p>
<p>As we learned about the different ways in which digital technology extends social services to traditionally underserved communities across multiple geographies and sectors, we also had the opportunity to introduce many of the participants to the <a href="digitalprinciples.org">Digital Principles</a> and share how the Principles can help guide their work and achieve sustainability. Participants who attended our Digital Principles session shared the challenges they face when implementing their solutions, the resources they wish they had available, and how they believed the Principles could be helpful in addressing these issues. Many insights shared by participants showcased common problems in the ICT sector and demonstrated how it is never too early to begin putting the Principles into practice.</p>
<p>The Unconference was an incredibly powerful and inspiring experience; we look forward to having DOT youths’ voices join and help shape the future of the Digital Principles as they continue to develop into tomorrow’s innovators and leaders bringing digital solutions to global communities.</p>

        <p>TL;DR Beware of connections to function objects accessing class members which could be triggered during execution of subclass destructor methods.</p> <h3>Oh, those name-based signal/slot connections feel outdated!</h3> <p>So you are a happy embracer of Qt&#8217;s new QObject signal/slot connection way of coding based on function-pointer or functor objects, like myself. This compile-time check of signals and slots feels just so much better. And thus you also port any existing code to it. Including some which uses the pimpl approach for some public classes, borrowing Qt&#8217;s macros <tt>Q_PRIVATE_SLOT</tt>, <tt>Q_D</tt> &amp; Co.:</p> <blockquote> <pre>class MyWidgetPrivate; class MyWidget : public QWidget { Q_OBJECT public: explicit MyWidget(QWidget *parent); // [...] // setting a QWidget-subclass to be used as custom form in this widget void setForm(Form *form); private: const QScopedPointer d_ptr; Q_PRIVATE_SLOT(d_func(), void handleFormDeleted()) }; // implementation side: class MyWidgetPrivate { // [...] public: void handleFormDeleted() { /*...*/ } }; MyWidget::MyWidget(QWidget *parent) : QWidget(parent) , d_ptr(new MyWidgetPrivate) { // [...] } void MyWidget::setForm(Form *form) { Q_D(MyWidget); // [...] connect(form, SIGNAL(destroyed()), this, SLOT(handleFormDeleted())); }</pre> </blockquote> <h3>Got some time, let&#8217;s modernize the code</h3> <p>The old code calls to be changed into using a connection from the <tt>destroyed</tt> signal to a lambda expression calling <tt>handleFormDeleted()</tt> directly on the private object, with <tt>MyWidget</tt> instance as context object, thus removing the need for that <tt>Q_PRIVATE_SLOT</tt>:</p> <blockquote> <pre>class MyWidgetPrivate; class MyWidget : public QWidget { Q_OBJECT public: explicit MyWidget(QWidget *parent); // [...] // setting a QWidget-subclass to be used as custom form in this widget void setForm(Form *form); private: const QScopedPointer d_ptr; }; </code> // implementation side: class MyWidgetPrivate { // [...] public: void handleFormDeleted() { /*...*/ } }; MyWidget::MyWidget(QWidget *parent) : QWidget(parent) , d_ptr(new MyWidgetPrivate) { // [...] } void MyWidget::setForm(Form *form) { Q_D(MyWidget); // [...] connect(form, &amp;QObject::destroyed, this, [this] { Q_D(MyWidget); d-&gt;handleFormDeleted(); }); }</pre> </blockquote> <p>Looks fine &amp; compiles. Code feels more future-proof with the compiler now warning if some signal or slots got changed/removed.</p> <h3>Ooops, crashing now?</h3> <p>Just&#8230; nooos, it sometimes crashes now, in the destructor of <tt>MyWidget</tt>. How that on this innocent looking change?</p> <p>Reading once more closely the documentation of <tt><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qobject.html#connect-5">QMetaObject::Connection QObject::connect(const QObject *sender, PointerToMemberFunction signal, const QObject *context, Functor functor, Qt::ConnectionType type = Qt::AutoConnection)</a></tt> we notice the remark:</p> <blockquote><p>The connection will automatically disconnect if the sender or the context is destroyed. However, you should take care that any objects used within the function object are still alive when the signal is emitted.</p></blockquote> <p>Which subtly hints to the problem we now have: if the <tt>form</tt> instance is set as child widget of the <tt>MyWidget</tt> instance, it will be deleted when <tt>~QWidget()</tt> is run as part of the <tt>MyWidget</tt> destructor. And then emit the <tt>destroyed</tt> signal. At that point in time <tt>this</tt> as seen by the function object no longer is a proper <tt>MyWidget</tt> instance. And things go *boom*.</p> <p>The old string-based connection as well as the member-function-pointer-based one handle that case for us, by some QObject magic using virtual methods which catch that the receiver no longer is a <tt>MyWidget</tt> and somehow then just drop the slot call (got lost in the code details, but it is something like this).<br /> While with the new function-object-based connection that one will only become automatically inactive by being destroyed if the ~QObject destructor of either sender or receiver is reached. So having a longer lifetime, which can come a bit unexpected to some.</p> <h3>Fixing the modern times, unsure how</h3> <p>Lesson learned: do not blindly port code to the context &amp; function object based connection. Instead beware of the additional traps which there are given that the function object is an independent complex object and not just a member function pointer. I will have to revisit quite some code where I might have missed this trap with the subclass destructor methods <img alt=":/" class="wp-smiley emoji" draggable="false" height="16" src="https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg" style="height: 1em;" width="16" /><br /> As I seemed not the only one hit by this, I filed <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-71432">QTBUG-71432: &#8220;API dox of context &amp; function object using QObject::connect should hint about destructor issues&#8221;</a> so other people like me might be saved from this from the start.</p> <p>Curious to learn about best practices for private slots and non-string-based connections. Thus happy to hear about proposals/hints in the comments.</p> <p>(Update: text now using C++ standard lingo term &#8220;function object&#8221; instead of &#8220;functor&#8221;)</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>When you think about the work of art historians or genetics researchers, installing database software is not the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, from 19 to 21 September, Wikimedians, art curators, and scientists <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2018-09-19-21-New-York">gathered at the New Museum</a> in New York City’s Lower East Side for a three-day workshop to talk about an emerging technology designed to make storing and structuring data free and accessible. The focal point was an increasingly vital piece of the Wikimedia ecosystem that makes linked data possible for everyone: Wikibase.</p>
<p>Wikibase is a little-known standalone piece of software that powers Wikimedia’s popular new linked-data project <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>.  (This is similar to how Wikipedia is powered by a general wiki software called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, which is used everywhere from NASA to MuppetWiki.)  Since 2012, Wikidata has been growing to fill an increasingly important role in the Wikimedia community: connecting, sharing and providing tools for turning Wikipedia’s text strings into useful, searchable, machine-readable.  Wikidata’s content informs research and cultural heritage institutions, as well as digital tools like Google’s Knowledge Graph. None of this would be possible without Wikibase—which makes the Wikidata’s linked open data project possible and practical.</p>
<p>In the last few years, an expanding community of researchers, GLAMs, and other knowledge communities have been experimenting with using Wikibase for their own repositories of knowledge, distinct from the central Wikidata knowledge collected by Wikimedians. But this nascent community of Wikibase reusers is just emerging, and deploying an open source technology not originally designed for third-party use can be challenging.</p>
<p>The September Wikidata workshop gathered a subgroup of these pioneering data explorers to better understand how to realize Wikibase as a robust independent project distinct from the Wikidata platform, and to turn it into a tool that can offer core infrastructure for the work of scholars and GLAMs as they collect, describe and analyze their diverse stores of both facts and artifacts.  The key question: how could Wikibase reach and meet the needs of professionals across a broad community of emerging and established institutions.</p>
<p>The gathering was made possible through a generous grant by the Sloan Foundation.  It was hosted and sponsored by one of the early adopters of this technology, <a href="http://rhizome.org">Rhizome</a> (documented in our Many Faces of Wikibase <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">blog series</a>), and co-organized with <a href="https://wikimedia.de/en">Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</a>.</p>
<h3>What do you talk about in a Wikibase workshop?</h3>
<p>The Wikibase workshop began with talks by participants highlighting their work in the realms of Wikidata, Wikibase, and more generally representing and working with linked data. Participants came with varying levels of experience with Wikidata and Wikibase, from interested newcomers to intrepid early adopters of the technology.  So, the presentations created an important baseline understanding of what is happening with Wikibase and what its possibilities and pain points are.</p>
<p>Day one explored both the many opportunities and the number of underlying concerns exploring and integrating a new technology. Are we the only ones experiencing challenges? Are there tools that could help us solve our problems? What kind of future can we build for increasing adoption of the software?</p>
<p>At the same time presenters brought striking examples of advanced use.  Digital art specialists described how they use Wikimedia tools for art preservation <em>Rhizome </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">using Wikibase</a>, and <em>SFMOMA</em> using Mediawiki. Michigan State University’s <a href="http://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> and Pratt University’s <a href="https://linkedjazz.org/">Linked Jazz Project</a> showed off the <a href="https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/wikibase-for-research-infrastructure-part-1-d3f640dfad34">power of wikibase and linked data for exploring the cultural record</a>.  GLAM professionals from the Smithsonian, New York’s METRO library consortium, and York University highlighted the potential applications of Wikidata to their own varied and vast collections spaces.</p>
<p>During the second day, we broke into working groups focused on understanding practical ways which Wikibase can be better supported for arts and research communities. Tracks focused on UI/UX improvements, making Wikibase easier to install and use, developing a Wikibase community, improving data modeling on Wikibase. The groups each provided <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/s/LOD-Wikibase-Summit-NYC">pages of documentation and specific recommendations</a> that can be used as part of Wikibase’s development going forward (including, for example, <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/zMnfc5tPTwa8ajcUiTzPQA?both">concept sketches</a> for changes to the platform that would help GLAM and humanities researchers use Wikibase).</p>
<p>By day three, the community in the room had a strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose: that we can imagine are future in which Wikibase powers GLAM and research institutions to strengthen the exchange and connection of knowledge. We wrapped up the workshop with a session of sharing and reflecting, and then finished documenting the event, with next steps and links to notes on the conference meetup page, technical feature requests on phabricator tickets, and this very blog post.</p>
<h3>It’s more than just gathering together—it’s about creating a community</h3>
<p>An overwhelming theme throughout the workshop was the questions of, <em>what’s next</em>? In the wrapup conversations, the answers came back to facilitating a growing community of users who want to apply the Wikibase technology to the work of researchers and GLAMs. Key to forming the community would be figuring out what stories we can tell, and how we can tell them to new audiences.</p>
<p>Most of the participants in the New York Workshop were new users of Wikibase—very much still learning. In a community-driven environment like Wikimedia, sometimes the best outcome of an event is developing a larger community of knowledge-holders, of individuals able to explain, support and facilitate understanding of a practice or set of projects. With the Wikibase workshop, we helped a larger group of community members share their knowledge and gain knowledge from others. So, the next time a question arises on the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug">Wikibase users mailing list</a>, or a colleague expresses as interest in Wikibase, they know who else to connect with. In short: the workshop helped produce more nodes in our growing Wikibase linked data network.</p>
<p>This budding community would not have been able to form without the amazing facilitation of Dragan Espenschied (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111053">Q111053</a> on Wikidata) from Rhizome and Sandra Müllrick from Wikimedia Deutschland, along with their teams.  The organizers facilitated a collegial, knowledge exchange that can lead to a growing web of Wikibase users and community participants.</p>

        <p><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom - October 24, 2018</strong></p> <p>2ndQuadrant today announced the release of <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/repmgr/">repmgr 4.2</a> This release includes support for PostgreSQL 11, the newest major release announced by the community last week.</p> <p>repmgr is the most popular tool for PostgreSQL replication and failover management. It enhances and complements the built-in replication capabilities in PostgreSQL; making it easy to set up and manage standby servers, check replication status, and perform administrative tasks such as switchover operations. The repmgrd daemon provides automatic failover capability to maximize database uptime, and can easily be integrated with other tools such as PgBouncer for high application availability.</p> <p>The principal new feature of repmgr 4.2 is the ability to "pause" the repmgr daemon (repmgrd) via the <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-pause.html">repmgr daemon pause</a> and the corresponding <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-unpause.html">repmgr daemon unpause</a> commands. These will temporarily prevent it from taking failover action. This is useful for activities like planned maintenance (e.g. database upgrades or switchovers) which previously required repmgrd to be shut down on all nodes. <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-standby-switchover.html">repmgr standby switchover</a> will automatically pause/unpause repmgrd, simplifying switchover operations. </p> <p>Additionally, the new <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-status.html">repmgr daemon status</a> command is available to provide an overview of repmgrd status on all nodes.</p> <p>For more details on this functionality, see the detailed <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgrd-pausing.html">documentation</a>.</p> <p>repmgr 4.2 also provides several usability enhancements:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter shutdown_check_timeout (default: 60 seconds).</strong> This provides an explicit timeout for repmgr standby switchover to check that the demotion candidate (current primary) has shut down. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter repmgr_ bindir.</strong> This facilitates remote invocation of repmgr when the repmgr binary is located somewhere other than the PostgreSQL binary directory, as it cannot be assumed all package maintainers will install repmgr there. This parameter is optional; if not set (default), repmgr will fall back to pg_ bindir (if set).</p> </li> <li> <p>repmgr cluster cleanup now accepts the --node-id option to delete records for only one node.</p> </li> <li> <p>When running repmgr cluster matrix and repmgr cluster crosscheck, repmgr will report nodes unreachable via SSH, and emit return code ERR_BAD_SSH. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For a detailed list of all changes, please read the complete release notes <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/dev/release-4.2.html">here</a>.</p> <p>Upgrade instructions are available <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/upgrading-repmgr-extension.html#UPGRADING-MAJOR-VERSION">here</a>.</p> <p>Packages and installation documentation are available via 2ndQuadrant’s public RPM and APT repositories from 2ndQuadrant <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation-packages.html">here</a>.</p> <p>Source files can be downloaded <a href="https://repmgr.org/download/repmgr-4.2.tar.gz">here</a> and installation instructions are available <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation.html">here</a>.</p> <p>repmgr is distributed under GPL v3.</p> <p>For more information, please send an email to <a href="info@2ndQuadrant.com">info@2ndQuadrant.com</a></p>

This release includes support for PostgreSQL 11, the newest major release announced last week by the community.</p> <p><a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/barman/">Barman</a> (Backup and Recovery Manager) is an open source administration tool for managing backup and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers. It allows you to perform remote backups of multiple servers in business critical environments and helps DBAs during the recovery phase. </p> <p>Barman v2.5 presents the following new features:</p> <ul> <li>Add support for PostgreSQL 11</li> <li>Add check-backup command. This verifies all WAL files required for consistency of a base backup are present in the archive. A new state is added (WAITING_FOR_WALS) after completing a base backup, and it is set to DONE only after all WALL files have been verified.</li> </ul> <p>This release also fixes decoding errors reading external commands output. A complete list of changes and bug fixes is available <a href="https://www.pgbarman.org/barman-2-5-released/">here</a>.</p> <p>Download and installation instructions are available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pgbarman/files/">here</a>.</p> <p>Barman is developed and maintained by 2ndQuadrant and distributed under GPL v3.</p> <p>For more information, please send an email to <a href="info@2ndQuadrant.com">info@2ndQuadrant.com</a></p>

<h2>Why Test Kernel?</h2>
<p>The kernel team is working on final integration for Kernel 4.19.  This version was just recently released, and will arrive soon in Fedora.<span id="more-6525"></span><br />This version will also be the shipping kernel for Fedora 29. So it’s to see whether it’s working well enough and catch any remaining issues.<span id="more-5604"></span><br />It’s also pretty easy to join in: all you’ll need is an iso (which you can grab from the wiki page).<span id="more-6151"></span><span id="more-5500"></span></p>
<h2>We need your help!</h2>
<p>All the instructions are on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2018-10-25_Kernel_4.19_Test_Day">wiki page</a>, so please read through and come help us test! As always, the event will be in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fedora-test-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>#fedora-test-day</code> on Freenode IRC</a>.</p>

Per aquest motiu, està dissenyat per facilitar-los la iniciació mitjançant un conjunt de tasques, que proveeixen organitzacions com el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic. Els preuniversitaris seleccionen les tasques i les treballen amb l’ajut d’un mentor durant vàries setmanes. Cada tasca té una durada de 3 a 5 hores i els estudiants disposen de 3 dies per acabar-la i després, si ho volen, continuar amb una de nova.<br /><br />Les tasques són de 5 tipus diferents i no únicament de programació, la qual cosa amplia a tots els escolars la possibilitat de presentar-s’hi. Al tractar-se d’un programa mundial, totes les preguntes, respostes i comunicacions es fan en anglès.<br /><br /><img height="139" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1WhH2ptYnjIoseZjQKliUhEftPNqsmIIrjRYsfoPn5ANAoi3daUCEBdJwUp4oC2_viPu7a1v20kvOg5GiL39l_EzdL6eN_9bzHuho5OknZR4zCfvodIPJd4gOypZqEvA_K_oPS-C" width="640" /><br /><br />El concurs està dotat amb diversos premis, que depenen del nombre de tasques que finalitzin i de quantes en facin els estudiants: des de diplomes de Google (1 tasca), samarretes (3 o més tasques), assuadores ii, fins i tot, guanyar un viatge a la central de Google, situada a Silicon Valley (Califòrnia), amb un familiar o tutor.<br /><br />Des del 2010, més de 4.500 estudiants de 99 països han participat en el programa Google Code-in. El Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic va gestionar el passat concurs 2017-2018 més de 500 estudiants de tot el món, entre els quals hi havia vàries dotzenes de lleidatans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Objectius </b>Que nenes i nens de Lleida i arreu del mòn aconsegueixin una experiència mundial única i amb una marca tan reconeguda com Google mitjançant la participació en aquesta nova edició. El Parc Científic, a través del seu laboratori Liquid Galaxy LAB, és un dels dissenyadors del programa. <br /><br /><b>Dates </b>El proper 23 d’octubre comença el termini per registrar-se i seleccionar les tasques a desenvolupar a través de la web <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">https://codein.withgoogle.com/</a>. <br />El concurs finalitza el 12 de desembre del 2018. Els estudiants necessiten un compte de Google per accedir-hi i un permís parental, que se’ls demana al registrar-se. Els participants han d’esperar que Google aprovi el permís abans de desenvolupar les tasques.<br /><br /><br /><b>Responsables </b>El Liquid Galaxy LAB, laboratori TIC del Parc Científic sota la coordinació d’Andreu Ibáñez i amb la col·laboració del Grup de Desenvolupadors Google de Lleida (GDG Lleida). Darrera hi ha un equip de 30 mentors de tot el món, que atenen els estudiants.<br /><br /><b>Contacte: lgcodein@gmail.com </b>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The news that optical physicist Donna Strickland <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/04/donna-strickland-wikipedia/">did not have a Wikipedia page</a> before winning the Nobel Prize in Physics brought renewed attention to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">Women in Red</a>, a long-standing volunteer effort to add more biographies about women to the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After the announcement, the Women in Red WikiProject had one of their best weeks ever, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_Stephenson-Goodknight">Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight</a>, the co-founder of Women in Red.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://denelezh.dicare.org/evolution.php?project=enwiki">Statistics [&#8230;] show</a> an increase in the number of women’s biographies during the week immediately after the Nobel Prize announcement,” she said. “I’ve also seen a dramatic increase [in interest] on social media.”</p>
<p>The news that more people are interested in contributing biographies about women to Wikipedia is gratifying to Stephenson-Goodnight, who co-founded Women in Red in 2015 after learning that only 15 percent of biographies on Wikipedia at the time were about women. (That number has since jumped to 17.67 percent, meaning an average of 72 new articles on women were added to English Wikipedia every single day for the past 3.5 years.)</p>
<p>In the past three years, Women in Red has collaborated with outside institutions like museums and libraries that want to put on edit-a-thons, and developed lists of “redlinks”—non-existing Wikipedia articles—of women who should have material written about them. But the group doesn’t stop at biographies.</p>
<p>“Our scope includes women&#8217;s works (such as the paintings they painted, the schools the founded, the conferences they convened), as well as women&#8217;s issues (such as women&#8217;s suffrage and women&#8217;s health),” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>A helpful space for newcomers</h3>
<p>Women in Red is known for helping newcomers navigate the technical rules of Wikipedia—which can be overwhelming for new contributors. Sue Barnum, a volunteer Librarian-in-Residence with Women in Red, points to the group’s friendly and helpful nature as a key reason why it has been so successful.</p>
<p>“We support one another and help each other with our articles, references and technical details. If you need help, we&#8217;re going to help or find someone who can,” she says. “I&#8217;ll try to help people get access to articles or books behind paywalls. Sometimes I&#8217;ll even go to nearby libraries to access the actual book to help people verify their sources if the book or journal is only available offline.”</p>
<h3>The focus is on why women matter</h3>
<p>Editor SusunW, a founding member of Women in Red, recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/Blog">wrote an essay</a> about why she focuses on writing about women on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“I learn as much from writing women’s biographies as I impart from telling their stories,” she writes. “For example, in the pre-internet world, the international links between people and the organizations in which they participated were much stronger than you might imagine. The analytical part of researching the interconnections, and reward of working with editors who want to improve articles, is a motivating factor to me—as is the hope that the women in generations who follow will grow up knowing that women have always been actively involved in the world around them and were not passively allowing the world to go by.”</p>
<p>Making women—and their role in history—more visible is a motivating factor for many participants to Women in Red.</p>
<p>“I grew up believing that women didn&#8217;t do anything interesting,” says Barnum. “It&#8217;s sad that I believed that, because it isn&#8217;t true. I believed this because women&#8217;s contributions become invisible, especially after their deaths. There are many articles I&#8217;ve worked on where a woman was quite nationally famous during her lifetime, but after she dies, she somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; to make it into the canon that describes the subject she was involved in. This is really tragic and I&#8217;m glad that there are historians out there writing about women who have been hidden in history.”</p>
<p><strong>You can make a difference</strong></p>
<p>Inspired to join Women in Red?  There are many ways to get involved. For starters, Women in Red has put together a p<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Primer_for_creating_women%27s_biographies">rimer for creating women&#8217;s biographies&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Women_in_Red">&#8220;ten Simple Rules for Creating Women&#8217;s Biographies&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to jump in, Barnum recommends starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Redlist_index">the lists</a> that Women in Red has put together on women that are notable by Wikipedia’s standards and who need biographies written about them.</p>
<p>“Pick someone from a subject area you enjoy writing about and then make sure you have several reliable sources to backup your writing,” she says.</p>
<p>SusunW adds that you don’t necessarily need to start with a full biography. “If there do not appear to be sufficient sources to add a standalone biography on a woman, she can be added to events she participated in and organizations she was involved with, provided reliable sourcing can confirm her activities.”</p>
<p>For example, if a woman participated in an academic conference, adding her name to the list of participants—with proper sourcing—may help someone write a biography about her at a later date.</p>
<p>And Stephenson-Goodnight says you can always update an existing article. “Add a reference, add an internal link to another article, fix the punctuation, or improve the opening paragraph,” she says.</p>
<h3>If you need help</h3>
<p>Don’t be overwhelmed if you start to edit and find yourself confused. There are many ways to get help! You can post on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">talk page of  Women in Red</a>, as well as the talk pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rosiestep">Rosie</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Megalibrarygirl">Sue</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SusunW">SusunW</a>. (A talk page is like a message board where people communicate about a topic or article.)</p>
<p>“If you get stuck or have questions, remember that all of us were new once and others helped us, so we&#8217;re glad to respond to your questions,” says Stephenson-Goodnight. “You can also reach me via Twitter or Facebook or email.”</p>
<p>And if you’d rather work with people in person, there are opportunities for that too.</p>
<p>“If you live near a city which has a Wikimedia Affiliate (Chapter, Thematic Organization, or User Group), check in with them regarding their events schedule. There&#8217;s an international list available on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup">this Meetup page</a>. Or ask us at Women in Red to assist you in the search,” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>Helping beyond editing</h3>
<p>And one last thing: you don’t need to edit Wikipedia to meaningfully contribute to Women in Red. You can tweet or post about new articles on social media (including the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiwomeninred">@WikiWomenInRed</a>), help find archival material, or help access photos that are licensed properly.</p>
<p>“Having people who are willing to reach out to individuals to secure a license for a picture to be used on Commons is very helpful,” says Barnum. “Others may have access to archives or books that are offline and can help provide access to other editors.”</p>
<p>And your work—whether an edit, a tweet, or a photo—is meaningful, and makes a difference <em>on </em>Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“We are making a difference, one article at a time, making for incremental corrections to the systemic bias depicted in the written canon,” says Stephenson-Goodknight. “I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything more worthwhile with my free time.”</p>

      <h5>2018-10-18T17:00:00.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Katherine Maher</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>This post ran in the </em>Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-maher-wikipedia-gender-bias-20181018-story.html"><em>on 18 October 2018</em></a>.</p>
<p>When Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize this month, she became only the third woman in history to receive the award in physics. An optical physicist at the University of Waterloo, Strickland is brilliant, accomplished and inspiring. To use Wikipedia parlance, she is very clearly notable.</p>
<p>Except that, somehow, she wasn’t. Despite her groundbreaking research on a method of generating laser beams with ultrashort pulses, Strickland did not have a Wikipedia page until shortly after her Nobel win.</p>
<p>Perhaps more disconcerting, a volunteer Wikipedia editor had drafted a page about Strickland in March only to have it declined in May. The reason: There wasn’t enough coverage of Strickland’s work in independent secondary sources to establish her notability. Her achievements simply weren’t documented in enough news articles that Wikipedia editors could cite.</p>
<p>Before Wikipedia points a finger that might rightly be pointed back at us, let me acknowledge that Wikipedia’s shortcomings are absolutely real. Our contributors are majority Western and mostly male, and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices. As a result, Wikipedia has dozens of articles about battleships and not nearly enough on poetry. We’ve got comprehensive coverage on college football but significantly less on African marathoners.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wikipedia is by design a living, breathing thing—a collection of knowledge that many sources, in aggregate, say is worth knowing. It is therefore a reflection of the world’s biases more than it is a cause of them.</p>
<p>We are working to correct biases in Wikipedia’s coverage. For instance, in 2014, Wikipedia editors evaluated all the biographies on English Wikipedia and found that only about 15% of them were about women. To rectify the imbalance, groups of volunteers, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_scientists">WikiProject Women Scientists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">WikiProject Women in Red</a>, have been identifying women who should have pages and creating articles about them.</p>
<p>Today, 17.82% of our biographies are about women. This near 3% jump may not sound like much, but it represents 86,182 new articles. That works out to 72 new articles a day, every single day, for the past three and a half years.</p>
<p>But signs of bias pop up in different ways. A 2015 study found that, on English Wikipedia, the word “divorced” appears more than four times as often in biographies of women than in biographies of men. We don’t fully know why, but it’s likely a multitude of factors, including the widespread tendency throughout history to describe the lives of women through their relationships with men.</p>
<p>Technology can help identify such problems. Wikipedia articles about health get close attention from our community of medical editors, but for years, some articles on critical women’s health issues, such as breastfeeding, languished under a “low importance” categorization. An algorithm identified this mistake.</p>
<p>But there is only so much Wikipedia itself can do. To fix Wikipedia’s gender imbalance, we need our contributors and editors to pay more attention to the accomplishments of women. This is true across all under-represented groups: people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Although we don’t believe that only women editors should write pages about other women, or writers of color about people of color, we do think that a broader base of contributors and editors—one that included more women and people of color, among others—would naturally help broaden our content.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is founded on the concept that every individual should be able to share freely in the sum of all knowledge. We believe in “knowledge equity,” <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction">which we define</a> as as the idea that diverse forms of knowledge should be recognized and respected. Wikipedia is not limited to what fits into a set of encyclopedias.</p>
<p>We also need other fields to identify and document diverse talent. If journalists, book publishers, scientific researchers, curators, academics, grant-makers and prize-awarding committees don’t recognize the work of women, Wikipedia’s editors have little foundation on which to build.</p>
<p>Increasingly, Wikipedia’s content and any biases therein have ramifications well beyond our own website. For instance, Wikipedia is now relied upon as a major source in the training of powerful artificial intelligence models, including models that underlie common technologies we all use.</p>
<p>In such training processes, computers ingest large data sets, draw inferences from patterns in the data and then generate predictions. As is well understood in the programming world, bad or incomplete data generate biased outcomes. This phenomenon is known by the acronym GIGO: garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>People may intuitively understand that Wikipedia is a perennial work in progress. Computers, on the other hand, simply process the data they’re given. If women account for only 17.82% of the data, we may find ourselves with software that thinks women are only 17.82% of what matters in the world.</p>
<p>It is true that Wikipedia has a problem if Donna Strickland, an accomplished physicist, is considered worthy of a page only when she receives the highest possible recognition in her field. But this problem reflects a far more consequential and intractable problem in the real world.</p>
<p>Wikipedia would like to encourage other knowledge-generating institutions to join us in our efforts to balance this inequity. We may not be able to change how society values women, but we can change how women are seen, and ensure that they are seen to begin with. That’s a start.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-18T00:00:00.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the release of PostgreSQL 11, the latest version of the world’s most advanced open source database.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 11 provides users with improvements to overall performance of the database system, with specific enhancements associated with very large databases and high computational workloads. Further, PostgreSQL 11 makes significant improvements to the table partitioning system, adds support for stored procedures capable of transaction management, improves query parallelism and adds parallelized data definition capabilities, and introduces just-in-time (JIT) compilation for accelerating the execution of expressions in queries.</p> <p>"For PostgreSQL 11, our development community focused on adding features that improve PostgreSQL's ability to manage very large databases," said Bruce Momjian, a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/developer/core/">core team member</a> of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL Global Development Group</a>. "On top of PostgreSQL's proven performance for transactional workloads, PostgreSQL 11 makes it even easier for developers to run big data applications at scale."</p> <p>PostgreSQL benefits from over 20 years of open source development and has become the preferred open source relational database for developers. The project continues to receive recognition across the industry, and has been featured as the "<a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/76">DBMS of the Year 2017</a>" by DB-Engines and in the <a href="https://sdtimes.com/sdtimes-100/2018/best-in-show/database-and-database-management-2018/">SD Times 2018 100</a>.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 11 is the first major release since PostgreSQL 10 was released on October 5, 2017. The next update release for PostgreSQL 11 containing bug fixes will be PostgreSQL 11.1, and the next major release with new features will be PostgreSQL 12.</p> <h2>Increased Robustness and Performance for Partitioning</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 11 adds the ability to partition data by a hash key, also known as hash partitioning, adding to the current ability to partition data in PostgreSQL by a list of values or by a range. PostgreSQL 11 further improves its data federation abilities with functionality improvements for partitions that use the PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/postgres-fdw.html">postgres_fdw</a>.</p> <p>To help with managing partitions, PostgreSQL 11 introduces a catch-all default partition for data that does not match a partition key, and the ability to create primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and triggers on partitioned tables that are passed down to all partitions. PostgreSQL 11 also supports automatically moving rows to the correct partition if the partition key for that row is updated.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 11 improves upon query performance when reading from partitions by using a new partition elimination strategy. Additionally, PostgreSQL 11 now supports the popular "upsert" feature on partitioned tables, which helps users to simplify application code and reduce network overhead when interacting with their data.</p> <h2>Transactions Supported in Stored Procedures</h2> <p>Developers have been able to create user-defined functions in PostgreSQL for over 20 years, but prior to PostgreSQL 11, these functions were unable to manage their own transactions. PostgreSQL 11 adds SQL procedures that can perform full transaction management within the body of a function, enabling developers to create more advanced server-side applications, such as ones involving incremental bulk data loading.</p> <p>SQL procedures can be created using the <code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code> command, executed using the <code>CALL</code> command, and are supported by the server-side procedural languages PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, and PL/Tcl.</p> <h2>Enhanced Capabilities for Query Parallelism</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 11 improves parallel query performance, with performance gains in parallel sequential scans and hash joins along with more efficient scans of partitioned data. PostgreSQL can now execute SELECT queries that use <code>UNION</code> in parallel if the underlying queries are unable to be parallelized.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 11 adds parallelism to several data definition commands, notably for the creation of B-tree indexes that are generated by executing the standard <code>CREATE INDEX</code> command. Several data definition commands that either create tables or materialized views from queries are also parallel capable now, including the <code>CREATE TABLE .. AS</code>, <code>SELECT INTO</code>, and <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code>.</p> <h2>Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for Expressions</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 11 introduces support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to accelerate the execution of certain expressions during query execution. JIT expression compilation for PostgreSQL uses the LLVM project to speed up the execution of expressions in WHERE clauses, target lists, aggregates, projections, and some internal operations.</p> <p>To take advantage of JIT compilation, you will need to install the LLVM dependencies and enable JIT compilation in either your PostgreSQL settings file by setting <code>jit = on</code> or from your PostgreSQL session by executing <code>SET jit = on</code>.</p> <h2>General User Experience Improvements</h2> <p>The enhancements to the PostgreSQL relational database are not possible without the feedback from an active user community and the hard work by the people who work on PostgreSQL. Below highlights a few of the many features included in PostgreSQL 11 designed to improve the overall user experience:</p> <ul> <li>Removing the need for <code>ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN .. DEFAULT ..</code> with a not <code>NULL</code> default to rewrite the whole table on execution, which provides a significant performance boost when running this command.</li> <li>"Covering indexes," which allows a user to add additional columns to an index using the <code>INCLUDE</code> clause and are helpful for performing index-only scans, especially on data types that are not indexable by B-tree indexes.</li> <li>Additional functionality for working with window functions, including allowing <code>RANGE</code> to use <code>PRECEDING</code>/<code>FOLLOWING</code>, <code>GROUPS</code>, and frame exclusion</li> <li>The inclusion of the keywords "quit" and "exit" in the PostgreSQL command-line interface to help make it easier to leave the command-line tool</li> </ul> <p>For a full list of features included in this release, please read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/release-11.html">release notes</a>, which can be found at:</p> <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/release-11.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/release-11.html</a></p> <h2>About PostgreSQL</h2> <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> is the world's most advanced open source database, with a global community of thousands of users, contributors, companies and organizations.

UN Global Pulse and the Digital Impact Alliance are excited to host a joint-session at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai to explore the operational aspects of using mobile phone network data as a public good. At the event, we are bringing various actors from government, UN Agencies, Mobile Network Operators and NGOs to share their research and on-the-ground experience of using mobile network data to inform decision making around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for humanitarian action.</p>
<p>With more than 5 billion people connected to mobile services in 2017 and projections of reaching 5.9 billion by 2025, or 71 per cent of the world’s population, the mobile phone sector has become increasingly important in helping achieve the SDGs. While the mobile industry has made great strides in supporting the SDGs, we are still far from realizing its full impact. A critical piece of the mobile industry’s impact lies in the data it generates for analysis, which governments, humanitarian and development organizations, and donors agree would be extremely beneficial to address key humanitarian issues and reach the SDGs by 2030.</p>
<p>Anonymised mobile network data contains information about population characteristics such as movements, density, location, social patterns, and finances. As this data is uniquely detailed and tractable, it can capture information not easily found from other sources at a scale that would be difficult to recreate through other means. Once anonymized and aggregated to appropriate levels, this data can provide a variety of insights with tremendous value for development partners, including but not limited to mobility, social interaction, and economic activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unglobalpulse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Pulse</a> has developed a series of proof-of-concepts for the use of mobile network data for public good, including tracking food security, informing disaster management and understanding seasonal migration, among others. We’re working not only with mobile operators around the world, but also with their industry trade organization, the GSMA. In 2017, GSMA established an explicit strategy around putting anonymiszed mobile big data to work for the public good. There are currently 19 mobile operators who are committed to the Big Data for Social Good initiative. This is exciting for us because it shows how data philanthropy could work at an industry-wide scale, rather than with just one partner at a time.</p>
<p>We also strive to catalyse the use of big data for public policy and humanitarian action by advancing normative frameworks and delivering learning experiences for policy makers across the world via our network of labs. At the World Data Forum, we hope to showcase some of our work in the South Pacific with Digicel and the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, informing responses to natural disasters in these contexts and shaping our thinking on how to scale this work, as well as share the experiences of our colleagues at ITU who are using mobile network data to better understand the development of information societies.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/what-we-do/data-for-development-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIAL’s Data for Development</a> portfolio focuses on unlocking the value of private sector data (including mobile network data) in a safe, standardized manner, utilizing technical, commercial and governance-driven innovation to help achieve impact and sustainability. DIAL is working with a global network of partners including country governments, mobile network operators, technology solutions providers, donors and implementation organizations to support the building and scaling of data-driven solutions to meet the SDGs. DIAL also provides capital and operational support for development and deployment of reusable digital building blocks (e.g. software platforms, data analytics tools) that are designed once but that can be tailored to fit unique sectoral and geographical needs. This October, DIAL will share updates and key learnings from our work in Uganda and Malawi, our platform investments, and from global research by inviting our key partners to share their experiences. While each of these projects has been different in terms of focus and lessons learnt, we’ve also identified high-level synthesis items at the ecosystem level, which are helping us understand what is needed to bring the use of mobile data to scale.</p>
<p>UNGP and DIAL are excited to co-host this panel given the overlap of our work and the recognition that in order to scale and sustain the use of mobile network data, we must share what we’ve learned so far and increase collaborative efforts. The UN World Data Forum provides a great opportunity to elevate the conversation so that we, as a data community, can work together to make the use of mobile network data more systemic and sustainable.</p>
<p>We hope you join our session and bring forth your ideas so that we can further develop practices and models that safely and responsibly use mobile data for public good.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-16T17:00:54.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">McKensie Mack</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Maybe you&#8217;ve already heard the story of how the global edit-a-thon known as <strong><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/">Art+Feminism</a></strong> got started. It goes something like this:</p>
<p>Five years ago, four friends—Siân Evans, Jacqueline Mabey, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak—gathered together to discuss an idea for promoting Wikipedia as a place to challenge one of the ways women are silenced: through the preservation of information. That discussion became the Art+Feminism campaign.</p>
<p>Our goals today still revolve around combating gender inequity on the internet, using Wikipedia as a tool for correcting the written record on cis and trans women. And in the last year, all of us—from the leadership collective to the thousands of organizers, artists, librarians, activists, and editors who make up our global Art+Feminism community—have experienced many lessons, challenges, and triumphs.</p>
<p>Take the month of March, for example. Over 4,000 people at more than 315 Art+Feminism events around the world came together to create or improve nearly 22,000 pages on Wikipedia, with a total of 43,000 content pages created or improved! That’s <em>four</em> times the output of our 2017 events. Four times. Out of 357 initiatives across 80 countries, we were named as 1 of 5 finalists in the <a href="https://twitter.com/equals/status/1041695010339606528">#EQUALSinTech</a> Leadership Award Category.</p>
<p>Our fifth-annual <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3941">Wikipedia edit-a-thon at the Museum of Modern Art</a>, an all-day event designed to generate coverage of feminism and the arts on Wikipedia, took place on 3 March 2018 with hundreds of partner events around the world. It featured tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, ongoing editing support, training on combating implicit and explicit biases, reference materials, childcare, and refreshments, with the leading panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcd1lfZ4ws">“Careful with Each Other, Dangerous Together,”</a> about the relationship between structures of inequality on the internet, the emotional labor of internet activism, and creating inclusive online communities with Caroline Sinders, Sydette Harry, Salome Asega, and Sarah Jaffe.</p>
<p>Art+Feminism’s regional organizers continue to amplify the way the project resonates with and reaches people all over the world. This year, <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/05/tentaciones/1522922021_036290.html">we focused on Latin America</a>, where Melissa Tamani has done concentrated outreach, quadrupling the number of events in that region compared to last year.  These nearly 30 events stretched from Laboratorio Cultural del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico, to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59270"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59270" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ArtAndFeminism-MoMA18-14-Panel.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">Panel discussion about Art+Feminism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, 3 March 2018.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>Our success is because of the commitment that we share with hundreds of organizers around the world to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/15/wikipedia-edit-a-thon-women-arts">the voices of cis and trans women made visible</a> and their achievements shared just as widely as their male identified peers. We want to see justice done and each year,  we work to refine our strategies, our organizing, and our materials so that they are made even more accessible than the year before. With that goal in mind, we launched our <em><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/organizing-kit/">Quick Guide for Organizers</a></em> and our <em><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/editing-kit/">Quick Guide for (New) Editors</a></em>. Both guides have been made available on our training materials page in English and Spanish. On 30 September of this year, we are launching our redesigned training guides for organizers in PPT form in English and Spanish with more guides to follow translated into French and at least one African language with the goal of translating our materials for new editors and organizers into at least five additional languages in the next three years of our campaign. In addition to content focused on quick tips for organizing edit-a-thons and editing Wikipedia for the first time; we’ll be launching even more materials in the future focused specifically on advancing gender justice on the internet, designing brave/safe space policies through a lens knowledge equity and anti-harassment, and more.</p>
<p>Beginning this project, we knew that our role would not only be to empower cis and trans women to edit online but to stand with them as they are challenged by those who do not see value in their perspective nor value in them. Art+Feminism is about making Wikipedia a more complete and representative source of information, but it doesn’t end there for us. It’s about dismantling systems of thought that diminish or erase entirely the place marginalized people and their communities have in our history.</p>
<p>As we have addressed many glaring omissions about women on Wikipedia, we have seen our focus turn towards improving existing articles: for example, the first year we created 101 new articles, and improved roughly the same number, while this year we improved 7 times as many articles as we created.</p>
<p>Our task is to take what we’ve made to the next level. From there, our task is to leverage the reach and impact of our social justice community to recognize that Wikipedia is just one of many tools that can be used to combat gender inequity and biased, informative content on the internet. We have so much to do, and we’re ready to take on the task of continuing to iterate and improve as our campaign evolves and adapts as it needs to.</p>
<p>Look at what we’ve done—and there&#8217;s even more to come.</p>

Several members of the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Operations</a> (CommOps) team were present for the conference. We also held a <a href="https://flock2018.sched.com/event/FjdQ/fedora-community-operations-hack-the-planet" target="_blank">half-day team sprint</a> for team members and interested people to participate and share feedback with the team.<br/></p>

<p>This blog post summarizes some of the high-level takeaways and next steps for CommOps based on the feedback we received.</p>

<h2>What we talked about</h2>

<p>Our team sprint was significant for planning future goals and milestones for CommOps. Our sprint was a hands-on session split between <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/appreciation-week/" target="_blank">Fedora Appreciation Week</a> planning and exploring new questions to answer in fedmsg metrics.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Fedora Appreciation Week</strong><ul><li>Revisited timeline, updated roadmap (see latest comments in <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/110" target="_blank">#110</a>)</li><li>First draft of new roadmap in <a href="https://etherpad.gnome.org/p/fedora-commops-flock-2018-session" target="_blank">Etherpad</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Metrics, fedmsg, and data analysis</strong><ul><li>Grimoire dashboard delayed – but how can we start answering questions now with tools we have today?</li><li>Interactive activity to generate ideas on most valuable / interesting metrics to review</li><li>Tentative plan on how to start</li></ul></li></ul>

<span id="more-6452"></span>

<h2>Deeper into metrics and data</h2>

<p>The metrics discussion was the longest part of our session and also the least planned for. The CommOps session was intentionally unstructured to benefit from the people in the room. A fedmsg developer joined us for the first half of the session, and along with many others, we explored possibilities for questions we can answer about Fedora with today&#8217;s data and tools.</p>

<h3>Reviewing Grimoire</h3>

<p>An interactive Grimoire dashboard with graphs, charts, and other visualizations is still desired, but we lost our lead developer this year. We looked to see if it is possible to salvage the plan, and decided to put it on hold until we can find development interest and support for a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedmsg-perceval-plugin" target="_blank">Perceval fedmsg ingestion plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Since Grimoire is blocked, the discussion drove towards answering data questions today with the tools we have now.<br/></p>

<h3>Brainstorming on sticky notes</h3>

<p>What do you do when you&#8217;re in a room full of people with different backgrounds and interests, and you don&#8217;t know how to make things less awkward? <em>Thankfully</em>, sticky notes are convenient to get everyone present involved and draw out unique ideas because of the diversity in the room. Next, we distributed sticky notes and asked a broad question: <strong>what questions do <em>you</em> want answered about Fedora?</strong></p>

<p>The responses were quite interesting and we had a lot of questions to sort through and arrange. We categorized and sorted similar ideas together and created three buckets, based on the buckets we identified at the <a href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-commops-fad-2018/" target="_blank">CommOps 2018 FAD</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CommOps-Flock-2018-scratch-pad-final.jpg" alt="Scratch notes from brainstorming at the Fedora Project Community Operations (CommOps) team sprint at Flock 2018 in Dresden, Germany" class="wp-image-6456" srcset="https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CommOps-Flock-2018-scratch-pad-final.jpg 3024w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CommOps-Flock-2018-scratch-pad-final-225x300.jpg 225w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CommOps-Flock-2018-scratch-pad-final-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CommOps-Flock-2018-scratch-pad-final-766x1021.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 3024px) 100vw, 3024px" /><figcaption>Scratch notes from brainstorming at the Fedora Project Community Operations (CommOps) team sprint at Flock 2018 in Dresden, Germany.</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The three &#8220;buckets&#8221; identified were as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Individual contributors</li><li>Teams / sub-projects</li><li>Overall Fedora Project community</li></ul>

<h3>Top metrics questions to explore</h3>

<p>For each bucket, we identified a top question we thought was both interesting and valuable, and could also be answered with fedmsg tools we have in place today.</p>

<h4>Question 1: Who contributes in a single, narrow place versus broadly and in many places?</h4>

<p>Do we have many contributors in specific, narrow places versus contributors working in many different areas? If so, could we better connect the narrow places to other parts of the community that find their input valuable? An example is connecting a sub-project or team to something like the Fedora Magazine or CommBlog for improved visibility.</p>

<h4>Question 2: What do drive-by contributors do?</h4>

<p>Do we have many small activities (in time needed to contribute) yet they generate high levels of activity by drive-by contributors? Can we get more visibility of some of these high-interest places across the wider community?</p>

<h2>Thinking ahead to 2019</h2>

<p>For the rest of 2018, our hands are full with <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/appreciation-week/" target="_blank">Fedora Appreciation Week</a> and other tasks (like migrating from our <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/issue/178" target="_blank">mailing list to Discourse</a>). However, we started to brainstorm high priority tasks to look at in 2019.</p>

<ul><li>Answer identified metrics questions from session</li><li>Begin writing <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/onboarding-guide">on-boarding guide</a> for publication</li></ul>

<h2>Better format for next time</h2>

<p>One suggestion for next year&#8217;s Flock conference: we had better engagement focusing on narrow, specific topics in our sub-project than having a broad, general focus of &#8220;team planning&#8221; for our session. We were better able to engage with everyone who decided to show up (since they had some sort of interest if they decided to join our session). When the scope was narrow and specific, people had several ideas and we opened an intersectionalist view on many of the things we&#8217;re doing (which is really what CommOps is all about).</p>

<p>We&#8217;re making progress to wrapping out 2018 on a high note, and Flock provided an opportunity for us to work together and plan for the future. All CommOps contributors as of today are remote, so the precious time a few of us get to spend together is valuable to plan ahead for huge gaps of time when we are apart and limited to IRC, mailing lists, and other text communication.</p>

<p>We hope to see you next year at the CommOps session at Flock!</p>

<p>Our mini data science experiment decided to look at five unique data points available to us via <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz Works</a>:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of recorded covers</li>
<li>Number of artists who covered a song</li>
<li>Release year</li>
<li>Year of last recorded cover</li>
<li>Time elapsed between release year and year of last recorded cover</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Originally, we looked at songs from different artists, but decided to look at five recordings from the same artist. With Queen being a notoriously famous band, there were several data points to work with in terms of how often a song was covered.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Making sense of the data</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A few explanations are necessary for some of the data, especially the difference in number of covers and number of artists. <em>Don&#8217;t Stop Me Now</em>, <em>Fat Bottomed Girls</em>, and <em>We Will Rock You</em> had the same number of recorded covers as number of artists who have covered the song. Why were <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> and <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> different?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As it turns out, <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> had more covers than the number of artists who have covered the song. This happens because some artists have covered the song twice (e.g. once on a studio release and another on a live recording release). On the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody had more artists covering it than number of covers because some recordings featured multiple artists on the same cover (e.g. the 1992 live performance with Elton John and Axl Rose).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The data opens many interesting questions. Why have some songs persisted longer than others (in terms of recent covers)? Have these songs impacted culture and society in different ways? How have they permeated culture? Is there geographical bias in the data?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This exercise was an exploratory assignment, but we had fun visualizing it and ended up learning an interesting pattern in music data.</p>

        <p>We are pleased to announce a $2 million gift to the Wikimedia Endowment from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros">George Soros</a>, one of the world&#8217;s leading philanthropists.</p>
<p>Soros is known for his extensive philanthropy to <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wall-street-donors/george-soros.html">support ideals underpinning a free and open society</a>, including access to knowledge, education, economic development and policy reform. He is also known for founding the Open Society Foundations, one of the preeminent international grantmaking networks supporting civil society groups around the world, and giving over $32 billion of his personal wealth to the organization.</p>
<p>“George’s generous gift to the future of free knowledge is reflective of his deep commitment to supporting openness in all its forms” said Katherine Maher, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation. “His gift will help us ensure the sum of all knowledge remains free and open for the benefit of generations to come.”</p>
<p>This gift provides vital momentum to the Wikimedia Endowment Campaign. Wikimedia believes that free knowledge is the foundation for human potential, opportunity, and freedom. Since the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikipedia_celebrates_15_years_of_free_knowledge">launch of the endowment in January 2016</a>, the campaign has raised over $26.5 million from generous donors, philanthropists, and Wikimedia community members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Endowment is not just a practical way to support Wikipedia,&#8221; Soros says. &#8220;My gift represents a commitment to the ideals of open knowledge—and to the long-term importance of free knowledge sources that benefit people around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The Wikimedia Endowment guarantees that the next generation of Wikipedia readers and contributors will have even better educational opportunities than the previous generations had,” said Peter Baldwin, co-founder of the Arcadia Fund, Wikimedia Endowment Board member, and long-time supporter. “Time and again George has been a philanthropic leader in ensuring access and opportunity around the world, and his gift to the endowment furthers that for generations to come.”</p>

      <h5>2018-10-12T17:00:44.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Srishti Sethi and Sarah Rodlund</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We’re always looking for ways to strengthen the open source ecosystem. Over the past two months, the Developer Advocacy team at the Wikimedia Foundation collaborated with two open source initiatives: Mozilla’s <a href="https://opensource.mozilla.community/">Open Source Student Network (OSSN)</a> and TeachingOpenSource.org&#8217;s <a href="http://foss2serve.org/index.php/POSSE">Professors&#8217; Open Source Software Experience</a>  (TOS and POSSE, respectively). OSSN is designed to bring more students into open source projects, while POSSE aims to provide more professional development resources for professors.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s pilot project, which is currently underway at colleges in the United States and Canada, aims to help university students find suitable open source projects to engage with. Before its launch, Mozilla researched the state of open source on college campuses, as well as criteria that students might consider in choosing a project. Based on this research, Mozilla developed <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/cracking-the-code-how-mozilla-is-helping-university-students-contribute-to-open-source-25fa630d8c5c">an overview template for project selection</a> that presents the four most relevant (and often not properly surfaced) criteria at a glance: the mission of the project, technology, time needed for setting up the development environment, and how to connect with the community.</p>
<p>POSSE, meanwhile, provides professional development experience to professors interested in teaching open source through Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects. POSSE began as an outreach effort by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat</a> to the higher education community.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, our team, met with the contributors to the Mozilla’s Open Source Student Network (OSSN) and POSSE initiative at the <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/">LibrePlanet conference</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We saw an opportunity to further support student contributors on the Wikimedia projects by collaborating with these two initiatives.</p>
<p>There are two primary reasons why we are excited about this collaboration.</p>
<p>First, we have received quite a lot of requests from professors or students interested in teaching open source in academia through Wikimedia projects. We get asked how to assess projects and incorporate them into semester-long coursework. We’ve always wondered how to help them best.</p>
<p>In the past, we have partnered directly with university faculty to help shape projects for their students, which are both educational for them and beneficial for us. For example, last spring we worked with graduate students and faculty in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Document_Re-working_Group/Technical_Communication_Outreach_and_Events#Technical_Communication_Collaboration,_Spring_2018:_BSU_&amp;_Cloud_Services_Technical_Documentation_Audit_and_Recommendations">Boise State University’s Technical Writing program to audit and evaluate technical documentation for our Cloud Services team.</a>  The students were able to advise a real world client (our team), and we used their valuable recommendations to inform our approach. We would love to be able to provide focused support like this to everyone who asks. We are often able to  provide a <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T169709">project showcase and developer support</a> help, but we find we also have to defer many requests.</p>
<p>Second, in our <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers/Quarterly#Summary_of_key_findings">year-long research study with 61 new developers to Wikimedia projects</a>, we learned that most new developers who we attract are working professionals. However, students get onboarded through our targeted outreach efforts via mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Google Code-in and mentoring programs at hackathons.</p>
<p>On the whole, this also ties into our <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T199001">bigger goal of collaborating with other FOSS communities</a> for engaging technical contributors.</p>
<p>This collaboration with both the initiatives in its initial state is quite straight-forward and not quite resource intensive! We&#8217;ve proposed five <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers">newcomer-friendly projects</a> to be listed in the OSSN&#8217;s directory of projects: <a href="https://projects.ossn.club/">https://projects.ossn.club/</a>. The project and mentor names are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES">ORES</a>, Aaron Halfaker</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Newsletter">Extension:Newsletter</a>, Tony Thomas</li>

</ul>
<p>“Joining forces with Wikimedia for findings more effective ways to support University students while they are trying to contribute code to Open Source Projects is exciting! Students are looking to contribute to projects that are simple, diverse and have an impact; which is precisely what Wikimedia projects offer. I appreciate the time effort the project maintainers are putting aside for onboarding and supporting new contributors and looking forward to working with them.” &#8211; <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/bacharakis/">Christos Bacharakis</a>, Mozilla Open Source Student Network &#8211; Program Manager</p>
<p>For POSSE, we are now <a href="http://foss2serve.org/index.php/HFOSS_Projects#Education">listed</a> as an organization in their directory of HFOSS projects under the Education category. The link contains getting started instructions. When we are approached by students and professors, we are willing to offer help!</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have the Wikimedia Foundation working with TOS to engage students in Wikimedia projects,&#8221; said <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/user/hislop/">Gregory Hislop</a> of the TOS Coordinating Committee. &#8220;Today’s students have grown up using Wikipedia, and they are quite interested in learning about the technology and community behind the project. The educational goals of Wikimedia also provide an excellent introduction to computing for social good. We appreciate the Wikimedia Foundation’s leadership in providing opportunities for students.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this collaboration, we are hoping to engage more university students in contributing to open source projects and support professors in their efforts of teaching open source through Wikimedia projects. We are looking forward to learning from the research findings that Mozilla will conduct post completion of the first pilot, which we could then leverage to improve some of our processes and workflows of supporting new developers. We would also be curious how professors use our projects to teach in a classroom setting, which we could then be shared with our collaborators in academia.</p>

        <h3>Writing about Islam in Hebrew: Dar AsSalam Editors</h3>
<p>Last January, Wikimedia communities around the world <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/01/30/community-digest-wikipedia-day-17/">celebrated Wikipedia’s seventeenth birthday</a>—and Wikimedia Israel joined in. Held at the IBM office in Tel Aviv, nearly 60 Wikimedians attended, including a group of Palestinian editors from the Dar AsSalam Islamic Center (meaning House of Peace) in Kafr Qara, Haifa district.</p>
<p>During the event, the Dar As-Salam group expressed their interest in volunteering to edit the Hebrew Wikipedia&#8217;s pages about Islam as a means to share Islamic culture with the Hebrew Wikipedia reader. A resulting few months of collaboration between the Dar AsSalam group and the Hebrew Wikipedia community has resulted the creation of 60 new pages, in addition to 150 others improved.</p>
<p>It all started when the Dar AsSalam group introduced themselves to the Hebrew Wikipedia community. They offered to improve the content about Islam, Islamic culture, history and theology on the Hebrew Wikipedia. In their conversations with veteran Hebrew Wikipedia editors, the group mentioned their need for support, and they got some from Avner Avandrovic, veteran Hebrew Wikipedian and a member of the training staff at Wikimedia Israel. Avandrovic traveled to Kafr Qara in March 2018 to lead a Wikipedia editing workshop. Moderated by Bekriah S. Mawasi, the Arabic Education coordinator at Wikimedia Israel, the meetings took place in Dar AsSalam center, located inside the Nour al-Haq mosque in Kafr Qara.</p>
<p>Dar AsSalam center is an information center aiming at providing information about Islam to Muslims and to visitors from different backgrounds and religions. The main objective of the center is to print out and give away Islamic books promoting the values of tolerance, moderation, openness, modesty and spirituality. Understanding other religions, develops curiosity about Islam. Another goal is creating a space for mutual understanding between different cultures in Israel as a way to promote a shared life, peace and respect for each other&#8217;s culture. The center publishes books and pamphlets explaining Islam, in both Hebrew and Arabic, including translation of the meanings of the Holy Koran.</p>
<p>The editing course at Dar AsSalam included three meetings. Twelve Arabic speaking participants participated in the workshops and edited content in Hebrew. In addition to learning technical skills and editing the Hebrew Wikipedia, editors were introduced to the norms and policies of the Hebrew Wikipedia community and were encouraged to participate in discussions. They also learned about encyclopedic writing on religious topics. The group showed proficient understanding and full collaboration, and by the third meeting in August, they had written over 60 new articles and edited more than 150 other ones. The articles were diverse in content, ranging from <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%97%D7%99%D7%90%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F">books</a>, <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%AA">theology</a>, and profiles of distinguished religious and historical figures. The group created new categories too and the mentioned achievements were completed within one month. They look forward to continuing in the future.</p>
<p>Members of Dar AsSalam made prolific contributions to the Hebrew Wikipedia with references in English and Hebrew. Wikimedia Israel appreciates the commitment the group showed to free knowledge. Five of the group members joined the celebrations of the 15th anniversary of Hebrew Wikipedia which took place in Tel Aviv on 10 August 2018. Such collaborations are great opportunities to share diverse opinions within the Wikipedia communities and enhances collaborative content writing in the largest knowledge base.</p>

<h3>GLAM activity kicks off in Indonesia with digitizing museum collections</h3>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div></div>
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="size-large wp-image-59209 aligncenter" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Lokakarya_digitalisasi_koleksi_Museum_Dr._H.C._Oemboe_Hina_Kapita_31_Mei_2018_05.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></div>
</div>
<p>Due to policy issues, museums in Indonesia are not widely utilized in education and learning. There has been some progress in the governance of the cultural sector, particularly by passing the Law of Cultural Advancement No.5/2017 last year. However, the artists and art communities are by far noted as the primary parties making considerable contributions within the Indonesian art world.</p>
<p>Given this landscape, a new GLAM-Wiki project could make a major difference in people&#8217;s access to digital collections in the Indonesian GLAM sector.</p>
<p>On 30 and 31 May, Wikimedia Indonesia, together with Indonesian Arts Coalition, arranged a visit to Dr. H.C. Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum in Waingapu, East Nusa Tenggara. The museum allowed us to digitize their collection, which ranged from ceramic plates, ritual ceremony equipment, a few of traditional percussions, and of course, Sumbanese’s proud: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat#Weft_ikat">Weft ikat</a>, traditional pattern textile.</p>
<p>On the first day, we started a discussion with the participants about how museums can respond to the digital era by utilizing technology to engage with the public. It is as easy as maintaining the information through apps and social media or using multimedia. The audience included museum staff, art practitioners, indigenous people and officials from the Office of Culture, Tourism, Public Library and Archive.</p>
<p>Most locals can afford smartphones and frequently go online on social media. Thus, it is merely a matter of first; the lack of references on various internet platforms, and second; the lack of awareness about the internet. We are looking forward to doing some outreach work introducing Wikimedia Commons and Creative Commons licenses, in which they are embraced to be more active in sharing files which link to the local heritage they possess.</p>
<p>On the second day we held a session for the participants to try their hands on Wikimedia Commons. We invited the museum staff members to guide the participants while they look around and pick the objects which represented local culture to be digitized, and this was the interesting part. The section where ceramic plates stored became our first destination. It was nice to see that at this phase both the staff and the audience starting to discuss the objects, which are believed to have a strong relationship with the Chinese trading, exchanging information to each other whilst enriching the story behind it. For instance, there was new information on one of the plates found inside the cemetery in an archaeological site.</p>
<p>Over the two day event, we have successfully digitized and uploaded <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Museum_Dr._(H.C)_Oemboe_Hina_Kapita">18 images</a> to Wikimedia Commons, including short descriptions about the objects.</p>
<p>“I could easily follow the instructions. There were no technical problems while working on Wikimedia Commons. I suppose we can do more to promote arts and culture in Sumba,” said Gusti Dida, a museum staff member who became a Wikimedia Commons contributor since then</p>
<p>The Sumba Museum, as it also is called, is the only museum in Waingapu, West Sumba, where the island is sometimes visited by local and foreign tourists because of its beautiful savanna, horse riding culture, and famous colorful weft ikat. The museum once temporarily closed and reopened in 2016, yet the collections are not well maintained. We were lucky to be invited by the Secretary of the Office of Culture and Tourism to hold this first GLAM activity in a local museum in Indonesia.</p>
<h4>Indonesian art and culture in the digital landscape</h4>
<p>Geographical and governance factors are the biggest challenges we are facing in building a digital environment for the Indonesian art and culture. Based on that, Wikimedia Indonesia is seeking to collaborate with local cultural institutions to digitize their archives as well as persuaded them to be the contributors to all kinds of Wikimedia platforms. Majalah Horison, one of the oldest Indonesian literature magazine and Majalah Kajawen, the Javanese magazine during colonial times are examples of the digitization projects that running ahead.</p>
<p>Now the museum staff of Dr. H.C Oemboe Hina Kapita Museum are able to produce and share knowledge by actively sharing their collection on Wikimedia Commons. At the end of the event, some participants were quite excited and offered the plan of making such follow-up activity in order to increase public attention towards the museum.</p>
<p>Any contribution on Wikimedia projects related to Indonesian art and culture could be seen as ways to building wider network and existence on the Internet, emphasizing the local’s possession of their own culture, their own narratives that complement the interpretation by others.</p>

This was the beginning of Shweta’s curiosity towards Wikipedia and to understanding how it worked. Shweta further explained that even 10 years after these instructions, she become a culprit of the same criticisms as she found herself offering the same advice to her students. In an attempt to do what was right and to clear her conscience in teaching her students the right way to use an encyclopedia, she first participated in a 100 Wikidays challenge. She was introduced to the campaign by a colleague who got her editing. Through these efforts she discovered her curiosity was justified as the instructions given to her may have not been quite accurate.</p>
<p style="background-color: #eeeeee;padding: 10px">Shweta gradually started outreach activities in Karnal to increase awareness amongst students and academics about her discovery, and her plight to completely detach the “unreliable tag” to Wikipedia led her to The Wikipedia Library Program (TWL). She volunteered to become the coordinator for the Hindi Branch. “As a researcher I knew how knowledgeable a well-referenced article could be and that the availability of resources will attract good editors and increase quality of content.&#8221; Her thoughts on how crucial well-referenced articles are to Wikipedia led her to the creation of the first branch in India, the Hindi TWL Branch.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-11T08:00:58.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Justin W. Flory</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the first rites of passage when working on a new project is creating your development environment. It always seems simple, but sometimes there are bumps along the way. The first activity I did to begin contributing to ListenBrainz was create my development environment. I wasn&#8217;t successful with the documentation in the README, so I had to play around and work with the project before I was even running it.</p>
<p>The first part of this post details how to set up your own development environment. Then, the second half talks about the solution I came up with and my first contribution back to the project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6920"></span></p>
<h2>Install dependencies: Docker</h2>
<p>This tutorial assumes you are using a Linux distribution. If you&#8217;re using a different operating system, install the necessary dependencies or packages with your preferred method.</p>
<p>ListenBrainz ships in Docker containers, which helps create your development environment and later deploy the application. Therefore, to work on the project, you need to install Docker and use containers for building the project. Containers save you from installing all of this on your own workstation!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m using Fedora, I run this command.</p>
<pre>sudo dnf install docker docker-compose</pre>
<h2>Register a MusicBrainz application</h2>
<p>Next, you need to register your application and get a OAuth token from MusicBrainz. Using the OAuth token lets you sign into your development environment with your MusicBrainz account. Then, you can import your plays from somewhere else.</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz applications page</a>. There, look for the option to <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register your application</a>. Fill out the form with these three options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: (any name you want and will recognize, I used <code>listenbrainz-server-devel</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>Web Application</code></li>
<li><strong>Callback URL</strong>: <code><a href="http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post</a></code></li>
</ul>
<p>After entering this information, you&#8217;ll have a OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret. You&#8217;ll use these for configuring ListenBrainz.</p>
<h4>Update config.py</h4>
<p>With your new client ID and secret, update the ListenBrainz configuration file. If this is your first time configuring ListenBrainz, copy the sample to a live configuration.</p>
<pre>cp listenbrainz/config.py.sample listenbrainz/config.py</pre>
<p>Next, open the file with your favorite text editor and look for this section.</p>
<pre># MusicBrainz OAuth
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID"
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET"</pre>
<p>Update the strings with your client ID and secret. After doing this, your ListenBrainz development environment is able to authenticate and log in from your MusicBrainz login.</p>
<h2>Initialize ListenBrainz databases</h2>
<p>Your development environment needs some databases present to work. Before proceeding, run these three commands to initialize the databases.</p>
<pre>docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_msb_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_influx</pre>
<p>Your development environment is now ready. Now, let&#8217;s actually see ListenBrainz load locally!</p>
<h2>Run the magic script</h2>
<p>Once you have done this, run the <code>develop.sh</code> script in the root of the repository. Using <code>docker-compose</code>, the script creates multiple Docker containers for the different services and parts of the ListenBrainz server. Running this script will start Redis, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and web server containers, to name a few. But this also makes it easy to stop them all later.</p>
<pre>./develop.sh</pre>
<p>You will see the containers build and eventually run. Leave the script running to see your development environment. Later, you can shut it down by pressing <code>CTRL^C</code>. Once everything is running, visit your new site from your browser!</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost/</a></p>
<p>Now, you are all set to begin making changes and testing them in your development environment!</p>
<h2>Making my first pull request</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, my first attempt at a development environment was unsuccessful. My system kept denying permission to the processes in the containers. After looking at system audit logs and running a temporary <code>setenforce 0</code>, I tried the script one more time. Everything suddenly worked! So the issue was mostly with SELinux.</p>
<p>With my goal to get my environment set up, I figured out a few issues with the configuration offered by the project developers. I eventually made <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR #257</a> against <code>listenbrainz-server</code> with my improvements.</p>
<h4>Labeling SELinux volume mounts</h4>
<p>To diagnose the issue, I started with a quick search and found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24288616/permission-denied-on-accessing-host-directory-in-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow question</a> with my same problem. There, the question was about Docker containers and denied permissions in the container. The answers explained it was an SELinux error and the context for the containers was not set. However, temporarily changing context for a directory didn&#8217;t seem too effective and doesn&#8217;t persist across reboots.</p>
<p>Continuing the search, I found an issue filed against <code>docker-compose</code> about the <code>:z</code> and <code>:Z</code> flags for volume mounts. These flags set SELinux context for containers, with the best explanation I found coming from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35222815/2497452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two suffixes :z or :Z can be added to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The &#8216;z&#8217; option tells Docker that the volume content will be shared between containers. Docker will label the content with a shared content label. Shared volumes labels allow all containers to read/write content. The &#8216;Z&#8217; option tells Docker to label the content with a private unshared label.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I added the <code>:z</code> flag to all the volume mounts in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. I submitted a fix upstream for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listenbrainz-server#257</a>!</p>
<h4>Correct the startup port</h4>
<p>In the README, it says the server will start on port 8000, but the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file actually started the server on port 80. I included a fix for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my pull request</a> as well.</p>
<h2>git push!</h2>
<p>This post makes a debugging experience that actually took hours look like it happened in minutes. But after getting over this hurdle, it was awesome to finally see ListenBrainz running locally on my workstation. It was an even better feeling when I could take my improvements and send them back in a pull request to ListenBrainz. Hopefully this will make it easier for others to create their own development environments and start hacking!</p>

        <h3>The great potential of AI: Scaling wiki-work</h3>
<p>At Wikimedia, AIs help us support quality control work, task routing, and other critical infrastructures for maintaining Wikipedia and other Wikimedia wikis. To make it easier to support wiki-work with AI’s, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2015/11/30/artificial-intelligence-x-ray-specs/">we built and maintain ORES</a>, an open AI service that provides several types of machine predictions to Wikimedia volunteers. For example, ORES’ damage detection system flags edits that appear (to a machine) to be sketchy, and this flag helps steer a real live human to review that edit, who will make sure it gets cleaned up if it is a problem. By highlighting edits that need review, we can reduce the overall reviewing workload of our volunteers by a factor of 10. This turns a 270 hours per day job into a 27 hours per day job. This also means that Wikipedia could grow by 10 times and our volunteers could keep up with the workload.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59180"><div class="img-in-text"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ORES_edit_quality_flow.svg"><img class="size-large wp-image-59180" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1024px-ORES_edit_quality_flow.svg.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="596" /></a></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">ORES' edit quality models flag edits that are likely to be vandalism for review.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>By deploying AIs that make Wikipedians&#8217; work more efficient, we make it easier to grow—to keep Wikipedia&#8217;s doors open. If counter-vandalism or another type of maintenance work in Wikipedia were to overwhelm our capacity, that would threaten our ability to keep Wikipedia <em>the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit</em>. This is exactly what happened recently around one of the quality control activities in Wikipedia. Reviewing new articles for vandalism and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:notability">notability</a> is a huge burden in English Wikipedia. Over 1,600 new article creations need to be reviewed every day. The group of volunteers who review new articles couldn&#8217;t keep up, and in the face of a growing backlog, they decided to disable new article creation for new editors. We&#8217;re actively working on AIs that can help filter and route new page creations, to lessen the workload and to make it easier to reopening article creation to new editors.</p>
<p>Without a strategy for increasing the efficiency of review work, reopening article creation to new editors would just re-introduce the same burden.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59181"><div class="img-in-text"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JADE_ORES_cycle.svg"><img class="size-large wp-image-59181" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1024px-JADE_ORES_cycle.svg.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="995" /></a></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">JADE collects examples of human judgement and ORES learns from that judgement to make predictions.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<h3>Biases and diversity</h3>
<p>But with all of the efficiency benefits that come with AI, we must be wary of problems. Humans have biases whether we choose to or not. When we train AIs to replicate human judgement, we can hope that <em>at best</em>, those AIs will only be biased in the same ways as their instructors. Worse, these and additional biases can appear in insidious ways because an AI is far more difficult to interrogate than a real live human being. Recently, the media and the research literature has been discussing ways in which bias creeps into AIs like ours. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeynep_Tufecki">Zeynep Tufecki</a> has warned that &#8220;We are in a new age of machine intelligence, and we should all be a little scared.&#8221;<sup>[1]</sup>And when we first announced ORES to our editing community, our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wnt">Wnt</a> urged us to &#8220;Please exercise <em>extreme caution</em> to avoid encoding racism or other biases into an AI scheme. [&#8230;] My feeling is that editors should keep a healthy skepticism &#8211; this was a project meant to be written, and reviewed, by people.&#8221;<sup>[2]</sup> We agree. AI-reinforced biases have the potential to exacerbate already embattled diversity in Wikipedia—especially if they will be used to help our volunteers more efficiently reject contributions that don&#8217;t fit the mold of what is typically accepted.</p>
<p>In order to directly address these biases, we&#8217;re trying a strategy that may be novel but will be familiar to Wikipedians. We&#8217;re working to open up ORES, our AI service, to be publicly audited by our volunteers. When we first deployed ORES, we noticed that many of our volunteers began to make wiki pages specifically for tracking its mistakes (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:ORES/Report_mistakes">Wikidata</a>, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progetto:Patrolling/ORES">Italian Wikipedia</a>, etc.). These mistake reports were essential for helping us recognize and mitigate issues that showed up in our AIs predictions. Interestingly, it was difficult for any individual to see any of the problematic trends. But when we worked together to record ORES&#8217; mistakes in a central location, it became easier to see trends and address them. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsFmqYxtt9w#t=29m03s">a presentation</a> by one of our research scientists on some of the biases we discovered and how we mitigated the issues.</p>
<p>By observing how Wikipedians gathered reports, we were able to recognize a set of pain points that made the process of auditing ORES difficult. From that, we&#8217;ve begun to design <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/JADE">JADE</a>—the Judgement and Dialog Engine. JADE is intended to make the work of critiquing our AIs easier by providing standardized ways to agree or disagree with an AI&#8217;s judgement. We&#8217;re building in ways for our volunteers to discuss and refine their own examples for training, testing, and checking on ORES in ways that are just too difficult to do with wiki pages.</p>
<h3>Open auditing and the future</h3>
<p>We think we&#8217;re onto something here. We need ORES and other AIs in order to help our volunteers scale up their wiki-work—to build Wikipedia and other open knowledge projects efficiently and in a way that aligns with our values of open knowledge. JADE is intended to put more power into our volunteers&#8217; hands, to help us make sure that we can take full advantage of AIs while efficiently detecting and addressing the biases and bugs that will inevitably appear. In this case, we&#8217;re hoping to lead by example. While some organizations responsible for managing online platforms actively prevent audits of their algorithms to protect their intellectual property (see the <a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ACLU-CFAA-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit by C. Sandvig et al.</a><sup>[3]</sup>), we&#8217;re preemptively opening up our AIs to public audits in the hope of making them better and more human.</p>

        <p class="article-date">NEW YORK, NY &#8211; Partners call on countries to take whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technologies.</p>
<p class="article-date">The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released a global call to action today, inviting governments, donors, technology vendors and other stakeholders to adopt a whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technology. The call to action builds upon a new Digital Investment Framework that DIAL and ITU have developed for global stakeholders which identifies digital technologies that are most important to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The launch of this new SDG Digital Investment Framework is the first step in DIAL and ITU’s ongoing collaboration. The Framework examined use cases in agriculture, education and the health sector and identifies a set of common, reusable ICT building blocks. For example, a few of the building blocks relate to identification, messaging and payment systems, all which can be reused across multiple development sectors. Investing in reusable ICT building blocks – like India and Estonia have approached their e-governance efforts – has been proven to increase efficiency, deliver a higher ROI for governments and create a platform-based ecosystem that attracts a higher volume of application providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“The Framework reinforces our commitment to breaking down barriers and looking for ways to institutionalize digital technology into development services,” said Kate Wilson, CEO, Digital Impact Alliance. “While this is our first joint initiative with ITU, we look forward to our continued work to help governments, the private sector, and donors make smarter and more strategic investments in digital technology to realize their potential to deliver SDG services to anyone, anywhere, at any time.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DIAL and ITU are inviting the development community to support a whole-of-government approach to deploying integrated digital services to achieve the SDGs. Whole-of-government refers to an approach whereby governments look across all sectors and organizations when considering how to invest in ICT infrastructure in an integrated and coordinated manner. Taking this holistic view helps countries realize economies of scale that are not possible when ICT is implemented in a piecemeal fashion. DIAL and ITU have proposed specific calls to action for governments, donors and technology implementers to use this approach and in return have outlined specific support the partners will provide to others.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Information and communication technologies are a key platform for development and a powerful tool to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, says Brahima Sanou, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau. “This Framework is an important tool to help policy makers and donors to identify and direct funds to more efficient and effective ICT investments that will ensure no one is left behind.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SDG commitments made by 193 countries were set to “transform our world” by 2030. Countries’ ability to achieve this goal is dependent on innovative uses of ICT services that can make existing programs more effective and scalable to better serve their population.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Despite billions of dollars invested over the last decade to integrate programs and digital technology, the development community has yet to see software providers creating applications to support the SDGs because investments are often siloed by sector, address a very small target audience and are designed for the short term,” said Jonathan Payne, Senior Policy Advisor at DIAL. &#8220;The SDG Digital Investment Framework and whole-of-government approach address these issues by fostering reusable ICT building blocks that can be implemented across multiple sectors to meet diverse development needs.”</p>

I was part of the contest as a mentor this year (for the first time) so naturally I had some instrument tasks ready for our participants. They were pretty popular, with a lot of tickets being added or improved by the participants. So, this is how serious we got for GCI:</p>

<p>The majority of these where done during autumn &#8217;17 and the first half of &#8217;18. The whole thing would have been finished in the summer, hadn&#8217;t May, June and July &#8217;18 been <a href="https://www.yr.no/artikkel/_-fleire-stadar-vil-nok-fa-34-grader_-1.14140919">the hottest summer</a> <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/record-breaking-heat-hits-norway-finland-and-sweden-20180718-p4zs3x.html">ever</a>! I just couldn&#8217;t think, so I took a break until August and then I finished dealing with the last few stragglers.</p>
<p>This version ended up including 58 tickets: the largest to date!<br />
What happens now? Well, at the end of the &#8220;Let&#8217;s get serious&#8221; version I noticed some issues with families and the like, but that&#8217;s a topic for the next blog post!</p>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;d been almost 2 years since I started, and I&#8217;ve managed to get quite a lot done! Here is a graph that illustrates the progress (notice the the jump in added tickets during GCI period, when the participants actually added them faster than I could close them!):<br />

      <div class="content">
        <p>To celebrate today’s International Day of Peace, Zach Tilton, evaluation specialist for the Digital Impact Alliance, reflects on his time working in peacetech and his career journey to leverage technology for peace and development.</p>
<p>As a young child, I remember sitting on my dad’s lap watching the green and black interface of the MS-DOS screen start up, hearing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvr9AMWEU-c">dial-up modem handshake</a> cacophonies as my mom logged on to the internet, and intercepting secret love-note faxes between my sister and her boyfriend. My father was an IT worker, my mother a technology specialist, and my older sister has since dumped the fax (and boyfriend) and now works in Big Tech. While technology runs in my family and has impacted my life beyond fond memories, this past summer I joined another digitally-literate family, the <a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/">Digital Impact Alliance</a>, to help tech have a lasting impact on the lives of others. This post highlights how my experiences with digital development and peacetech underscore why I believe in DIAL’s mission.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth in digital development in 2011, when I helped build and manage an online course for advanced mediation skills during my <a href="https://davidomckaycenter.com/#mckay-center">undergraduate peacebuilding program</a>. During a mediation role-play with some students based in Fiji, who had experienced two coups d&#8217;état in the previous decade, I was struck by the role technology was playing in delivering critical services to underserved populations. Years later as <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/morocco/">Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco</a>, I led an monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) task force to utilize higher rates of mobile devices in the field (85 percent from 57 percent in the previous cohort) to test mobile data collection methods and hold program-wide conversations about improving cultures of accountability and learning.</p>
<p>I eventually connected with <a href="https://howtobuildup.org/">Build Up</a>, a social enterprise that convenes peacebuilders, technologists, and artists, and works on <a href="https://www.stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.cv/">peacetech</a> related initiatives. Aside from volunteering and presenting at their annual <a href="https://howtobuildpeace.org/">Build Peace </a>conferences over the years, I recently worked on two peacetech projects: a <a href="https://peacehack.io/2017/09/12/peacehackldn2017-robotsforpeace/">#peacehack</a> where participants built Twitter bots to amplify the message of International Peace Day and a <a href="https://medium.com/@howtobuildup/building-the-commons-dc60e6ee7b69">campaign</a> following the 2016 US presidential election that utilized Twitter bots and social network analysis to address political polarization, burst filter bubbles, and bring people together for virtual dialogue about polarizing issues.</p>
<p>Throughout all these experiences, despite the number of bots, mobile devices, or automated learning modules, I found technology and program designs were only as good as the people and values behind them. As it turns out, there is evidence to back this up. My love-letter-faxing sister, <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/">Jennifer Brook</a>, is still using tech to make connections, just as a Design Researcher for Dropbox. I recently read one of her <a href="https://content.yudu.com/web/16f77/0A432f8/SchoolOfLife2017/html/index.html?page=80&amp;origin=reader">reports</a> where her research team uncovered a key characteristic of successful, tech-enabled teams is an explicit <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/work/prototyping-peace">social contract</a>, or an articulation of what values inform their approach and how they work together.</p>
<p>Incidentally, DIAL is one of the biggest proponents of social contracts in the digital development space. As steward of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org">Principles for Digital Development</a>, DIAL advocates for ecosystem actors to recognize, commit to, and become <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/">signatories</a> of generally accepted standards of technology for development. Internally, DIAL not only practices the Digital Principles, but has developed an organizational social contract, what we call our Values Agreement, to inform and evaluate our work. From business operations meetings, decisions about future investments, strategy discussions, design and work planning, even down to program-specific monitoring, evaluation, and learning plans, DIAL team-members strive to highlight and work by the values we’ve articulated and signed onto.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16807 size-full" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="1908" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg 4032w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a>These conversations are not always easy, but having an explicit values agreement gives us a north-star to guide us though this challenging work. In an era of unintended consequences in official development assistance, social contracts like the Digital Principles and internal value agreements help DIAL and other ecosystem partners ethically and intentionally realize the vision of a world in which the underserved benefit from digital technology.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello,<br />
I am Chhavi. I have mostly been helping around with all things design in MetaBrainz. I recently graduated from IIT Guwahati, India and started contributing to MusicBrainz after attending the summit last year, around the same time.</p>
<p>As a Google Summer of Code student, my project was to <a href="https://community.metabrainz.org/t/gsoc-2018-react-based-ui-component-library/364623">build a design system</a> with React UI components for the upcoming overhaul of MusicBrainz&#8217;s website. It surely was a really interesting journey, right from when I heard about the community and I would like to share some snippets of it with you!</p>
<p><strong>May 2017:</strong> I hear about Picard, and how a bunch of really cool people who meet online are building it. I was intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>Around August 2017:</strong> I pop in the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">IRC channel</a> #metabrainz, and after much overthinking, I drop a &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Followed was a really warm welcome by people I will soon call friends and a lot of developer-y jargon I had no clue about.</p>
<p><strong>September 2017:</strong> I attend the annual <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/11/03/metabrainz-summit-17/">MusicBrainz developer summit</a> in Barcelona. And boy oh boy, I am now part of the family. Over the few days there, I have immense fun interacting and learning from the community.</p>
<p><strong>November 2017:</strong> We set up our <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&amp;view=detail&amp;selectedIssue=MBS-9652">JIRA ticket system</a> for design issues and start working on the mockups for the redesign. The entire community comes together on JIRA tickets and Discourse posts to talk about where we want to go with this overhaul.</p>
<p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Community members encourage me to try my hand at front-end development. One is really lucky to find people, who encourage you to grow out of your comfort zone and help you cross that wall. In MetaBrainz, there is no shortage of such kind of people.</p>
<p><strong>March 2018:</strong> With little confidence and lots of hopes, I apply for the Google Summer of Code programme. I start learning the ropes of development, with help of online tutorials and obviously our community. We also met for a <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/03/26/delhi-mini-summit-2018/">mini-summit in Delhi</a> to discuss ListenBrainz and spicy food.</p>
<p><strong>April 2018:</strong> Hence began my full-fledged journey of learning and spending a summer of coding. It wasn&#8217;t easy, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p>We set up the initial design system using react-bootstrap and react-storybook. I then started importing UI components into the system, followed by its documentation. I wrote up a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chhavijustme/8feddbe5016365e2d6757a3605607fb9">more detailed description of the process</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>August 2018:</strong> As of now, we have the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/design-system">design system</a> in place. The future plan is to continue adding components to it as well focus on having well thought contributing guidelines. I will also continue working on designing the mockups for the user interface for various entities.</p>
<p>Google Summer of Code was just another milestone in my journey with MetaBrainz. My time here has been a time of both personal and professional growth. I now feel more comfortable in a development environment, the ongoing chats on IRC make more sense to me and I feel less inhibited to put my thoughts out there. I completed my college, moved cities, traveled… all while having a set of these amazing people I call family.</p>
<p>A special shout out to Rob for keeping me going, bitmap for being ever so patient and understanding, samj1912 for introducing me to MetaBrainz, CatQuest, iliekcomputers, Suyash, Freso, reo and zas for being amazing friends through it all.</p>
<p>The thing I like about our community is, we had seasoned developers as well as newbies like me, all together working together to create amazing stuff. Hoping to continue being an involved and colorful part of this community,</p>
<p>You will obviously keep hearing from me in the coming days,<br />
Chhavi</p>

        <p>Many moons ago people clamoured for a way for them to use MusicBrainz via their old FreeDB (and others) enabled players. The hope was that this would be a short term solution as more players picked up MusicBrainz support so we created the FreeDB gateway that allowed old clients to use an ancient interface to look up CDs with MusicBrainz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2007/06/25/freedb-musicbrainz-gateway-now-available/">maintaining this gateway for over 11 years now</a> and recently we had a user asking questions about their new music player and that they were having a hard time getting it to work with our FreeDB gateway.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Someone is developing specifically for a stop-gap measure? Clearly the goal of FreeDB gateway has been misconceived and people are not treating it as a gateway to using the proper MusicBrainz API endpoints.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re no longer keen on supporting this gateway and have been having trouble finding volunteers to maintain it. Our internal staff has enough to do with our own duties and have no interest in further maintaining this and neither do I.</p>
<p>For these reasons the FreeDB gateway is going away in 6 months time; March 18 will be the absolute last day that the gateway will be functioning. Should something crash and the gateway experience problems before then, we&#8217;ll just kill the VM that the gateway is running on and call it a day.</p>
<p>11 years of temporary is enough &#8212; if you use this service, migrate to a proper MusicBrainz endpoint <strong>right now</strong>!</p>

        <p>Today we&#8217;re going to migrate the AcousticBrainz service from its standalone server that we&#8217;ve rented in the past few years to our shared infrastructure at Hetzner. We&#8217;ve been prepping for this move for a few weeks now and the actual process to follow has been used before, so we don&#8217;t expect the downtime to be more than 1 hour.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sorry for the downtime that will be coming &#8212; to keep up with what we&#8217;re doing, please <a href="https://twitter.com/acousticbrainz">follow our progress on Twitter</a>. We hope to start the migration in the next hour or two from when this blog post goes up.</p>

<p>The original post was featured on GSMA Conference Confidential and can be found <a href="http://cc.gsma.com/digital-inclusion-the-role-of-the-mobile-network-operator-in-africa/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Mobile 360 Africa series brings together leaders from Africa’s technology and telecom industries for one of Africa’s largest gathering of technology practitioners. Mobile network operators, donors, development partners, technology companies and startups all convene to engage in thought provoking conversations and showcase innovations that can take Africa to the next level of technology advancement.</p>
<p>The recent Mobile 360 Africa series was held in the land of a thousand hills: Rwanda. Hosted at the Kigali Convention Centre, I had the privilege of having a one-on-one fireside chat with Phillip Amoateng, the phenomenal advocate for mobile internet skills in Airtel CEO for Rwanda.</p>
<p>The fireside chat, <strong>‘Digital Inclusion: The role of the operator in Africa,’</strong> took place during the session <strong>‘Is the Digital Landscape Inclusive for All.’</strong> In this increasingly connected and digital world, consumers are using a wide range of mobile-enabled services for education, agriculture, health, finance and utilities. But despite significant growth in mobile usage across developed regions, in low- and middle-income countries, certain segments of society are being left behind: women, individuals with less education, rural residents, and the poor account for a disproportionate number of those not connected.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have seen increased investments in infrastructure and growth of mobile subscriptions. But it’s not just infrastructure that needs continued investments – users still exhibit limited user capabilities, with most adults in low- and middle-income countries not having basic digital skills and competences. Across Africa, seven in ten people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it. Even in Europe, 19 percent of adults lack the literacy skills, and 45 percent lack the basic digital skills, needed to function fully in a modern society. Interestingly, women are 1.6 times more likely than men to report lack of digital skills as a factor limiting their use of the internet.</p>
<p>Thus, it was interesting to learn from Phillip about the strides that Airtel Rwanda has taken in enhancing mobile internet skills training in a quest to enhance the ability of users to use basic internet applications, understand internet bundles and how to check balances.</p>
<p>On the Mobile Internet Skills Training pilot that Airtel conducted in Rwanda, which reached a quarter of a million subscribers with 300 agents, Phillip said it was encouraging to see first-time internet users discover the value of internet based applications. Tigo sales agents were trained by Airtel/Tigo staff, who then in turn, trained customers that visited their shops.</p>
<p><strong><em>“We learned that customers once taught, would create a ripple effect by training other community embers within their circle.”</em></strong></p>
<p>And the benefit of creating a learning environment is transformative.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Being internet literate is not just about being online but also being available for opportunities. Apart from being in constant contact with friends and families there are also economic benefits and opportunities such as new and better jobs. We highlight the value of the internet as a means of enhancing opportunities for jobs, learning, and business, and more.”</em></strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the roles MNOs can play in addressing challenges of affordability and digital skills training. MNOs can leverage partnerships with education institutions and non-formal education structures to enhance mobile internet skills training. With increasing smart phone penetration, apps will make learning internet skills easier.</p>
<p>As I left the Better Future Stage having had such an insightful conversation with Phillip, I wondered what would happen if all mobile network operators integrated mobile internet skills training for mobile users, particularly those within the low literacy bracket. The number of digitally illiterate Africans would drastically reduce and create more opportunities for communication, learning, jobs and businesses. The future of mobile internet is vast and it’s up to us to make sure everyone is included in its benefits.</p>

        <p>My journey from Python to Golang via Node.js</p><p>Ever since college, I dabbled with Python, made a few scripts here and there, built some websites with Flask and Django. It was the first language I referred to anyone because it was quite easy to start with and delivers amazing results to the developers in no time. Although it was quite a break from having to program in C and Java, the language felt lacking in some of the most important areas.</p><h3>The deal breaker</h3><p>Now came Node.js into my life and I began experimenting with concurrency patterns. Backend JavaScript? Who would take that seriously? At best, it seemed like a new attempt to make server-side development easier at the cost of performance, scalability, etc. Maybe it’s just my ingrained developer skepticism, but there’s always been that alarm that goes off in my brain when I read about something being fast and easy and production-level.</p><p>Node.js became my go to language for a very long time. I got used to the latest programming syntaxes with using ES7 in the client side of things. The single threaded node event-loop made miracles possible for me, without severing any kind of performance and being cheap to use. As time passed, I began a deeper dive into the world of npm modules and the architecture of Node.js. It is a magical space filled with unicorns and rainbows.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*In5xU4obN2qlDEMAyPwg_w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Performance at it’s best?</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers have heard about Node’s non-blocking I/O model; it’s great because it means all requests are handled asynchronously without blocking execution, or incurring any overhead (like with threads and processes) and as the developer you can be blissfully unaware what’s happening in the backend. However, it’s always important to keep in mind that Node is single-threaded which means none of your code runs in parallel. I/O may not block the server but your code certainly does. If you call sleep for 5 seconds, your server will be unresponsive during that time. But my actual problem came with JavaScript. I know most of you will feel this like a rant and there are ways to solve this problem. Please, just bear with me through this.</p><p>When people were developing JavaScript, they wanted it to do all sorts of things and serve every other purpose. It all started with those thoughts, which made it kind of messy. Determining boolean outcomes in plain old JavaScript is hard.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TdKBZcFORJk1sMuKmELNTw.jpeg" /><figcaption>True? False? Confused all in all.</figcaption></figure><pre>// all true</pre><pre>1 == '1';<br />1 == [1];<br />'1' == [1];</pre><pre>// all false</pre><pre>1 === '1';<br />1 === [1];<br />'1' === [1];</pre><p>The internal type system of JavaScript is a mixed bag with six different types which causes all sorts of havoc to the end user.</p><ul><li>Undefined (a variable with no defined value)</li><li>Null (a single null value)</li><li>Boolean (true or false)</li><li>Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!)</li><li>String (textual data)</li><li>Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)</li></ul><p>I know there are ways to sort out these issues effectively, but a language experiencing these sorts of mutability can be problematic to users who are new to JavaScript world.</p><p>Then comes callback hell and having to deal with Promises and all in all the new keywords async and await . I always had retrospection over my language choices and it became very clear that I need strong typing and I can’t live without it. I tried TypeScript but it seemed a bit too expressive to start with.</p><h3>The Second Deal Breaker</h3><p>My main requirements for a language were speed, reliability, built-in concurrency patterns, a strong type system, garbage collection and lots of tooling. It’s not until recent times that I felt the need for all this stuff. I heard rumours earlier about Google building a new language that is going to change the world. True to the naming, it really brought about some deal breaking changes. Here’s a list of things I like about Go and why you’ll love it too.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L3wZZlN4wBjuF-W1vLfhCw.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>go get -u programmer.life/success</strong></figcaption></figure><h4>Opinionated</h4><p>Yes, it is very opinionated. But, I love the way of doing things in one way. With Golang, to do something, there’s just one way of doing it. The official tooling built around Go ensures that we do follow the one way.</p><h4>Goroutines</h4><p>The first half of Go’s concurrency paradigms. Lightweight, concurrent function execution. You can spawn tons of these if needed and the Go runtime multiplexes them onto the configured number of CPUs/Threads as needed. They start with a super small stack that can grow (and shrink) via dynamic allocation (and freeing). They are as simple as go f(x), where f() is a function.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_c9Ob50Cdmh09wLSzHRKgQ.png" /><figcaption>I am strong. Because my dad wanted me to be.</figcaption></figure><h4>Channels</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/1*H2Qh0oiHP64TkG4-Nnjtng.png" /></figure><p>The other half of Go’s concurrency story. Channels are a typed conduit used to send and receive values. These are used to pass values to and from Goroutines for processing. They are by default unbuffered, meaning synchronous and blocking. They can also be buffered, allowing values to queue up inside of them for processing. Multiple go routines can read/write to them at the same time without having to take locks. Go also has primitives for reading from multiple channels simultaneously via the select statement.</p><h4>Compiled Static Binaries</h4><p>Go compiles your program into a <strong>static binary</strong>. Yep, you heard it right. A <strong>static binary</strong>. This makes deployment really simple. Just copy the binary and it should be good to go. No pip install, no virtualenv, no freaking npm install . All of that is handled at compile time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BES005dHRZzV4WBtA7XV7Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>Binaries defeat all!</figcaption></figure><h4>Cross Compilation</h4><p>This is too good to be true. But it is. Yes. Golang allows cross compilation. Ever wanted to test your program on Windows but you use Linux? No more installing compilation tools and building it again on windows. Simply, use GOOS=windows and you can compile it on a Mac or a Linux machine. It even allows changing the architecture of the platform with GOARCH . There’s a laundry list of available platforms and OSes. You can find the list <a href="https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63">here</a>.</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go is a complied language, but still has a runtime. It handles all of the details of mallocing memory for you, allocating/deallocating space for variables, etc. Memory used by variables lasts as long as the variables are referenced, which is usually the scope of a function. Go has a garbage collector.</p><h4>Pass by Value</h4><p>“For the love of all holy Mary, please don’t bring back pointers.” And, well, yeah, they almost averted the crisis in the case of Golang. Everything is passed by value, but there are pointers. It’s just that the value of a pointer is a memory location, so it acts as pass by reference. This means that, by default, there is no shared state between functions. But, you can pass a pointer if you desire/need it for performance/memory utilization reasons. Go does the right thing by default, but doesn’t shackle you. Oh, and there isn’t any pointer math, so you won’t screw yourself with it. As pointed out on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5196498">HN</a>, you can do pointer math with the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/">“unsafe”</a> package and unsafe.Pointer.</p><h4>Type System</h4><p>Go has structs and interfaces. Go’s structs can have methods <em>associated</em> with them. Structs can be anonymously included in other structs to make the inside struct’s variables/methods available as part of the enclosting struct. Interfaces are sets of method signatures. Structs implement an interface by implementing the methods described by the interface definition. Functions can receive values by interface, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/KfKLiAClQE">so</a>. The compiler checks all of this at compile time.</p><h4>Package System</h4><p>Or lack there of. Since Go compiles everything statically, you don’t have to worry about packages at runtime. But how do you include libraries into your code? Simply by importing them via url, like so: import "github.com/bmizerany/pq". Go’s tooling knows how to look that up and clone the repo. Also works with Mercurial, Bazaar &amp; Subversion. go get it, my boy.</p><h4>Anon. Functions &amp; Closures</h4><p>Go supports anonymous functions that can form closures. These functions can then be passed around and retain the environment under which they were created, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/4rYrqw4l7m">so</a>. This can be super powerful when <a href="https://github.com/freeformz/filechan">combined</a> with channels and go routines.</p><h4>Built in profiling</h4><p>It supports pprof as a part of the standard library. And with a <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">very small bit of work</a>, you can access profiling info via a http interface.</p><h4>Defer</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/340/1*9IyFa5ur0nALjTmnACHkGQ.png" /><figcaption>I love to postpone work, yeah.</figcaption></figure><p>Ever forget to close a file descriptor or free some memory? So have the designers of Go. The reason for this is that you usually have to perform those actions far away from where the resources were opened/allocated. Go solves this problem with the defer statement. Each defer statement pushes a function/expression onto a stack that get’s executed in LIFO order after the enclosing function returns. This makes cleanup really easy, after opened a file, just defer file.Close().</p><h4>Comprehensive Standard Library</h4><p>Go’s <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/">standard library</a> is pretty comprehensive.</p><h4>It’s Fast</h4><p>Go compiles down to native code and it does it fast. Usually in just a few seconds. No matter if you have a million package imports. It does compile in seconds. There’s a rumour that Golang actually came to life over a discussion developers had during a <em>code compilation</em> break.</p><h4>Comprehensive Tooling Out Of The Box</h4><p>Go do a go --help. Some of my favorites: go fmt, go doc, go fix go get go tool pprof&amp; go test.</p><h4>Straight Forward Testing</h4><p>Super <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/testing/">straight foward</a>, no magic. And hell, yeah, it even has a <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">race detector</a> that finds out all your runtime woes even before hitting production.</p><h4>Simple C Interface</h4><p>By using build directives you can integrate with C libraries really <a href="https://gist.github.com/freeformz/4552031">easily</a>.</p><h4>Straight Forward Syntax / Standard Formatting</h4><p>The syntax is pretty simple, C like w/o all the crazy of C. But what’s really nice is go fmt, which re-writes your code into the Go standard format. No more arguments like tabs vs spaces or indentation rules! There’s just one way and you have to stick to it my friend.</p><h3>Golang’s Cons</h3><p>With all of that said, it’s not perfect…</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go’s runtime is not super <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_does_Go_perform_badly_on_benchmark_x">tuned</a> yet. By comparison the JVM has had over 18 years of development history behind it. But, for a 1.0.X runtime &amp; language, Go is pretty damn good.</p><h4>Garbage Collector</h4><p>Go programs can malloc a lot of ram at times, even when the program itself isn’t using much. Most of this shows up as VIRT though, so most linux systems just won’t care.</p><h4>1 CPU by default</h4><p>This is going to change over time, but the runtime will, by default, use only <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_no_multi_CPU">one CPU</a>.</p><p>I can bear with having a few cons. After all nothing is perfect in this world. I can live by knowing that there are a few disadvantages while using a language as long as they don’t affect programming like JavaScript’s falsity or callback hell.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=681a70f3bc79" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79">The Gopher way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>A short story on how things changed.</p><p>2017 was a massive year in my life as a developer. It brought about no small changes both in how I go about writing code as well as how I interact with other developers. The one thing that “<strong>matter</strong><em>ed the</em> <strong>most</strong>” is <strong>collaboration</strong>.<strong> 🙌</strong> It’s not just that open source development demands a greater degree of collaboration, but the acceleration of open source as a movement on all ends during the past few years has actually redefined how software development is done. It became a highly collaborative process with distributed version control systems everywhere. 🌍</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*v5o3JVZVH_74c8gl-k6Pmw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Open source ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>This totally changed the way I write code 💻 . To begin with, it has helped me <em>organise my development workflow</em>. For example, when I want to work on a bug fix or a new feature, I can <strong>branch</strong> off anytime. While <strong>Git</strong> has had an impact on how I personally write code, what has transformed software development into a truly collaborative process has been the rise of code hosting services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which provide tools for implementing a collaboration <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">workflow</a> based on Git, with work isolated into branches, organized into commits and documented with commit messages.</p><p>Google Summer of Code 2017 was the one major thing in my life that totally changed it. 😇 I was initially only hoping to finish up the project to 💰 gain money. Only now do I understand that money is the least of the goodies from GSoC. To start with, it gave me new friends 👬 and connections. That is the huge part of the deal. Being a GSoC alumni, you can dive into any of the GSoC summits taking place everywhere in the world. Although I haven't attended any yet, I’m planning on visiting somewhere next year. I’m so thankful to my mentors for patiently <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/we-all-have-bad-days-f59a334f0641">bearing with me through GSoC</a>. Our interaction during the small period of three months brought about some of the most interesting changes in my life. I was offered a contract as a part time freelancer while still being in college. That moment when you really can pay your bills 🎉 was epic. I worked for almost an year of college and it never felt burdening as some of my friends said it would. 😏</p><p>Then comes Mozilla 🦊 into my life. 20th November 2017, marks the day we applied for Mozilla Open Source Support. We were initially so skeptical about the deal and were not sure how much our project aligns to Mozilla’s 🔐 privacy guidelines. Our product wasn’t much focused on privacy, so we had our doubts. We waited patiently through the first couple of months and then lost our hope gradually. But, miraculously, 😍 they reached out to us after five months with the news that I was awarded with the Mozilla Open Source Support Award 2017. By the time I was aware of the news, our project was halfway done. This really eased things up for me. Although the total period of the project was a whopping 12 months, we finished it up in almost half the time thanks to my enthusiastic mentors.</p><p>I never attended a college placement as I wasn’t keen on doing a full time job and wanted to continue as a freelancer. I also have plans for higher studies, so I didn’t want to pull myself into job woes 😩. Initially, I regretted my decision for not attending on-campus placements soon after I left college. Almost all of my friends were busy starting their new lives at companies. It felt so lonely and disturbing. That was the moment I decided to go full out on the search for a job. With about two years of open source record on my resume, it wasn’t that difficult to gain a job in the world outside of placements. I was contacted by atleast 20 companies in the span of a month and I started making choices. I attended 3 interviews and got selected 💃 in two of them. By the end of the month, I had two opportunities to choose from. Then, came my saviour, ❤️Lasse, one of my mentors from GSoC. He brought to me another opportunity to work with a community of people I’ve already known from GSoC. Imagine how refreshing 😍 it would feel to continue working with people whom you already love to work with. I dished out all other options and went with my mentor. I never had the thought that landing a job would be this effortless, provided you have good connections. And a GSoC really helped me get those good connections. I kind of hoped that “making choices” part would come to my life at some point. But, I never knew that it would be so early in life. (I am still 20 😁)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/666/1*77t4yNKlgeHMN1selgRqlA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Welcome to the Dark Side.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>I hope your journey into open source would be as enriching for you as it has been for me.</blockquote><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f5a1e4f6417d" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/how-open-source-turned-my-life-around-f5a1e4f6417d">How Open Source turned my Life Around.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>By <a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/dial-staff/"><em>Michael Downey</em></a></p>
<p>In the technology field, late Summer and early Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere is the traditional conference season &#8212; a time for colleagues to pause to reconnect with each other, learn about trends and challenges in the industry, and of course, build new relationships and strengthen old ones. For the past 20 years now, one of the biggest of these gatherings of creators and consumers of open source software has been the O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or">OSCON</a>). DIAL&#8217;s Open Source Center team just returned from the event in Portland, Oregon, and once again left informed and refreshed as open source enters its third decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16226 size-medium" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As Director of Community for the DIAL <a href="http://www.osc.dial.community/">Open Source Center</a>, I primarily focus on the power of people to build technology to improve the reach and impact of international development and humanitarian response work, and to bring people in our field together to tackle new problems and find new ways to collaborate. That&#8217;s why the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/">Community Leadership Summit</a>, held each year just before OSCON, was particularly valuable this year. An &#8220;unconference&#8221;, the content of the event is driven by participants. I hosted the &#8220;Beyond Fiscal Sponsors&#8221; session, where experts honed in on the challenges and gaps faced by open source software projects and how organizations like DIAL and our Open Source Center can fill those gaps and amplify the impact of software projects &#8212; not only in the development &amp; humanitarian sectors, but also in all types of open source work.</p>
<p>Two days of tutorials and in-depth workshops followed for the team, on topics from giving better technical presentations, to coaching engineering team members, to technology platforms like Kubernetes, containers, and continuous delivery. Finally, there were two days of keynotes and shorter technical talks, enabling us learn about the work of our open source colleagues around the world as the develop best practices.</p>
<p>Of course, there were many exciting conve<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16228 alignright" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>rsations for our team along the way. David McCann, the Center&#8217;s Director of Technology, sat down with O&#8217;Reilly Media to talk a little bit about the United Nations Foundation, DIAL, and how the Open Source Center is working to turbocharge projects in the international development space. Check out the interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgekpgk2Uc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the weeklong event, the entire team &#8212; including the newest member of our team, Heath Arensen, was able to meet and brainstorm with key players in the tech industry about how we might adapt the lessons they&#8217;ve learned to build more financially sustainable open source software projects with long-lasting impact. We had great discussions sharing success stories and ideas for how to strengthen this invaluable effort to build even more technology capacity and launch more technology careers for women, people in the Global South, and other under-represented groups.</p>
<p>On the final day of the week, I presented a talk about the DIAL Open Source Center, how open source software is being used in critical humanitarian and development world in every part of the world, and how we&#8217;re helping to mitigate some of the risk involved by providing additional resources and services to those projects.</p>
<p>Conferences are major investments of time and energy, but the time spent on forging new relationships and partnerships, as well as teaching others about what we&#8217;ve learned, helps to increase the impact of every bit of work we do the rest of the year. Again this year, we were very grateful for the opportunity to be surrounding by thousands of our colleagues for such a vibrant and busy week.</p>

        <p>When I moved to Vermont, I spent a year working as an AmeriCorps/VISTA volunteer on adult literacy, which was a powerful and eye-opening experience into the world of public health and vulnerable populations. It inspired me to go on to medical school, where I learned some important life skills like how to doze off standing up, deliver babies, and how to take on the honor of holding hands with people as they died. After residency I did a fellowship in sports medicine and developed a practice in that field. I continued to practice medicine part-time in urgent care while I moved on to work full-time in the for-profit health informatics industry.</p>
<p>I found the informatics work fascinating, mostly because of the challenges and failures that persisted across practices and hospitals despite access to significant resources and infrastructure. It was surprising to me how much inefficiency and lack of interoperability there was, and most didn’t seem to know how to leverage technology for the sake of better outcomes. There was confusion among the actors around government standards and expectations, even among the governing bodies themselves. While this was my first exposure to challenges faced when integrating tech, it wouldn’t be my last. It’s frustrating to see the potential of technology not be realized in what otherwise seemed like an optimal health care setting.</p>

<p>While I was practicing medicine, I was also starting a family. It was during this phase of my life when my career path solidified. When I first met my oldest son, he was 8 months old and living in an orphanage in Addis Ababa. I’ve since gotten to know his birth mom and her story about making the decision to relinquish him. While my younger son’s story is unique as he was several years older when we first me and from a different region of Ethiopia, his birth family faced similar life-changing challenges. Through our family and our Ethiopian family’s experiences, I was drawn to better understand how it could be that such loving families had to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.</p>
<p>I began volunteering for an NGO that implements programming in Ethiopia, <a href="https://www.whfc.org/">Wide Horizons For Children</a>, focused on reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and empowering families. Many of their projects, which typically focus on health, education and financial stability, utilize digital technology for implementation. This may be in the form of using cell phones to access assessment tools to support health extension workers or data collection for school feeding programs. With limited funding and capacity, this NGO faced some of the same challenges I saw during my time in the for-profit informatics world. On their own, they can’t address their digital technology challenges in a way that would allow them to scale-up, innovate, leverage work from other sectors and reduce redundancy or achieve sustainability.</p>

While here, I’m working on creating public facing documents on what we’ve been calling the Advanced Market Commitment vaccine research. This encompasses the work DIAL did with PATH that investigated the market-shaping mechanisms that changed the way vaccines were procured. It also includes new thinking from DIAL and the Tableau Foundation on drawing lessons learned that can expand access to digital markets. Stay tuned for the release of the research!

        <h4>That was me until the past week.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P-VQUqX0isRifLoC4M-vEw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Embrace your life. Image credits: Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure><p>It can be frustrating to to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job or lifestyle. I hear about people travelling all time to far flung places, or spending days outside, and the only thing that I can think of is how unfair it is that I’m cooped up in my home, with the only view of outside being the screen in front of me.</p><p>However, as someone like me who likes to make the most of each day, (not just weekends!), there are a few things I do to make even my most mundane Mondays a little brighter, because I’m a big believer that every day should be made ridiculously amazing!</p><h4>Get up an hour earlier.</h4><p>Yes. I know my friends. We all are insomniacs and stay up all night doing all kinds of things. But, do give it a try, an early sleep and early rise can truly fresh up your day a lot. Use the time to take a stroll down to a park or even just the sidewalk, if you don’t live near any park. Frantically running into showers, driving or walking to the office, and sitting at your desk before your body has even had time to adjust to your new day, only worsens your day. Set yourself a tone for the mellower day, instead.</p><h4>Make a to-do list in the morning.</h4><p>Thanks to few of my colleagues, I recently started writing up to-do lists at work. It feels so refreshing at the end of the day seeing all those check marks. To give it a try, I brought the same change to my life, not just work. It just feels too good to be true, that simple things like these really refresh your day. But this trick really does work.</p><h4>Make movement non-negotiable.</h4><p>Halfway through your morning and through the afternoon, I force myself to standup and walk around. (Couldn’t do that earlier, so, I forced my laptop to go to sleep, if I didn’t have a walk in time.) I’m trying to do this as often as possible. This helped me have a break from all the problems at work. Work is just work to get paid. It shouldn’t be haunting your afterlife.</p><h4>At lunch, get away from your computer.</h4><p>Be in the moment. Enjoy whatever the food you are eating. Get outside and have a walk, read a book or just take in the day for whatever amount of time you can spare.</p><h4>Do something different each evening.</h4><p>This helps in keeping you away from boredom. Routine way of life gets you bored easily. Don’t just come home, eat dinner and relax on the couch. We should mix things up, if anything go for a long drive out into the wilderness, have a hike planned, take your pet for a walk or visit a beach, watch some movies (the kind you have never seen before) or just have bonfires in the backyard. Just because it is “an evening in the weekdays” doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it!</p><h4>Don’t go into an eating rut!</h4><p>Have something you really enjoy for each meal. Even if it it’s something cooked at home, have a change of menu everyday. And I tried cooking something on my own, didn’t turn out to be good, but it really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Plan out some fun dinner, which is both fun to make and eat! Once you start experimenting in the kitchen, it is hard to stop and the possibilities are endless!</p><h4>Reminiscing your day before bed.</h4><p>Be thankful for everything that happened during the day. The most important thing of all these things is to practice mindfulness throughout the day. Even on your way to work, which may seem like the most mundane thing ever, take in the weather, the sounds, the sights. At work, notice the people around you, and make the best of whatever your job might be. You’re there, so may as well make the best of it and take pride in your accomplishments. Our world is always changing, every second of every hour, so make sure you witness as much of it as you can.</p><p>Hope this helps at least someone in their life. If these tricks really helped you too, take time to throw in some claps. Follow me for more such updates.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8a53889a5635" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/im-bored-of-life-8a53889a5635">I’m bored of life.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>Blog post from Syed Raza, DIAL, and <a href="http://www.flowminder.org/people/jonathan-gray">Jonathan Gray</a>, Flowminder.</p>
<p>Timely, accurate, high-resolution information on populations distributions, characteristics and movements are key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Data that can help us to understand these key features of human populations are however lacking in many low and middle-income countries. A particularly interesting new data type, that can shed light on human populations and development challenges, comes from mobile network operators. Mobile Operators register Call Detail Records (CDRs) contain the time and associated cell tower of text messages, calls and other billable events. In de-identified format, these CDRs can be used to study human behaviour and mobility patterns at large scale, in near-real time and most importantly in places where other sources of data are not available.</p>
<p>With the number of mobile phone subscriptions constantly increasing around the world, this provides unprecedented opportunities to improve our understanding of human populations and better answer to the needs of vulnerable populations. Worldwide, we reached the five billion mark of mobile phone subscription in 2017 – with the latest one billion subscribers being reached in only four years (GSMA, 2017). Nearly 70% of the economically bottom fifth of the population in low-and middle-income countries now own a mobile phone. Based on this enormous growth, CDR data can for example support development activities in areas such as public health, poverty alleviation and infrastructure planning, as well as preparedness and response to disasters.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) will deliver <em>FlowKit</em>, an open source, state of the art and easy-to-use toolkit that will strengthen and facilitate large-scale analyses of mobile operator data for development and humanitarian purposes. Our team will be rolling out a series of releases starting in the Autumn 2018, alongside documentation and templates. The releases will contain our present internal code base, documented and structured to be suitable for the open source community, as well as a number of expansions to the toolkit. User groups amongst Mobile Network Operators in low and middle-income countries and leading humanitarian and development agencies will support the validation of requirements, roadmaps and functionality.</p>
<p>Led by engineers, data scientists and subject area experts at Flowminder, the project will empower Mobile Network Operators and organisations to use insights from mobile operator data to improve their country’s development policy and disaster response. Our team has a track record of producing insights from CDR data to support development and humanitarian community with targeted analyses for decision support, as well as publishing peer-reviewed <a href="http://www.flowminder.org/work/research-innovation">academic work</a> on the use of mobile operator data. We will leverage this experience to provide the community with an expandable open source system that can support diverse tools using mobile operator data. This is an exciting collaboration and we warmly extend an invitation to developers to get involved.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>There is little doubt that mobile plays a critical role in facilitating services for the developing world and in collective efforts to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. Governments are beginning to recognize the reach and costs/benefits of using mobile channels, and are taking an active role in scaling up mobile-enabled programs.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, for example, the Ministry of Agriculture increased the disbursement of fertilizers, seeds, and other agriculture resources from 10 percent to 90 percent by implementing an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNnLCSMFS9A">e-wallet solution</a>. The program contributed an additional 30 billion USD to Nigeria’s GDP in under two years.</p>
<p>Despite a growing number of such examples of scaling, many mobile-enabled development programs remain stuck in the pilot stage, often citing difficulties in procuring and provisioning mobile services.</p>
<p>A key issue is fragmentation of both demand and supply. In many emerging markets, there are often numerous but disjointed projects with different implementers and donors, which require the same suite of mobile services. Fragmentation of supply further exacerbates this situation, with multiple mobile operators providing service in a country.  Reaching national scale requires cross-operator negotiation, which is often fraught, slow and difficult to execute.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we see signs of the market attempting to align itself on both the demand and supply sides.  Coordinated bulk procurement can be highly beneficial to both. Customers get lower rates and potentially better service, while suppliers reduce the overhead of working with multiple parties and have larger volumes to work with. USAID recently developed a <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-inclusion/broadband-demand-aggregation">field guide</a> on demand aggregation and is identifying partners to test and implement demand aggregation within its missions. On the supply side, we see the rise of technology organizations like Africa&#8217;s Talking, Cellulant and SynqAfrica, which address commercial and technical integrations with multiple carriers, and others like Viamo, EngageSpark and Praekelt, which provide platforms that sit on top of those integrations to deliver mobile-enabled services.</p>
<p>At the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL), we believe there is great potential in these efforts for both telecoms and development/humanitarian organizations. We have been working on a series of interconnected tools, collectively known as <strong>DIAL’s Mobile Market Model</strong> to bring these parties closer together. This model aims to answer three questions that we have heard time and again from development practitioners and implementers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Are we even speaking the same language?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Mobile and NGO sectors often miscommunicate with one another because of their differing objectives and professional contexts. While there may be a common understanding of the channels at play (SMS, voice, USSD, and mobile Internet), understandings of the capabilities involved is often misaligned. For instance, do we need one-way or two-way for SMS? Do we need confirmation that an SMS has been sent or received?  Why are any of the above important? Performance can also affect requisite features, which impacts the price. For example, sending 10,000 SMSs over the day differs greatly from sending them all in a half-hour span after dinner when many are checking their phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Who can we work with (beside mobile operators)?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even for those with a clear idea of what they want, there is a dizzying variety of players to procure from. Should we negotiate directly with the mobile operators in a country? Should we work with a mobile aggregator, who has already done the work of integrating across different operators? Do we want an aggregator who can simply procure channels at the best price, or one who offers additional services?</p>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa for example, DIAL has conducted an initial scan and discovered at least three aggregators with national coverage in over 23 countries, representing connections with over 40 operators – albeit with different channels. These players may enable NGOs to reach national scale without the hassle of individual commercial and technical negotiations. However, we also need to better understand why partnerships leveraging these players have not previously been prominent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How much mobile demand are we talking about, really?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, mobile service providers make decisions on pricing and service provision based on customer demand. With adequate visibility of demand, mobile providers may provide more compelling deals and even provide capability in areas not immediately commercial in nature. Quantifying this demand, however, requires extensive consultation in the field and gathering requirements from multiple stakeholders who may find projecting their growing needs into the future difficult. In addition, aligning procurement between different organizations with different funding sources presents an operational challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer the above, we are developing a view of the market model as it applies to the mobile and NGO sectors i.e. which products are of interest, who the customers are and what they want, and who the suppliers are and what they are ready to offer. Whether you are an implementer seeking a mobile partner, or a mobile service provider looking to understand the demand, or an intermediary organization, stay tuned for the release of the following tools and learnings of the Mobile Market Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Mobile Capability Model:</strong> suggests common language and terminology on mobile services for both development actors and mobile providers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glossary of common core mobile channels (e.g. SMS, USSD, voice, airtime, mobile money, mobile Internet)</li>
<li>Capabilities within each channel relevant to development needs (e.g. for SMS, the difference between MT and MO, one-way and two-way, delivery reporting, sender IDs, and reverse / zero-rating)</li>
<li>Mapping of capabilities to user journeys, in a few archetypical mobile use cases (e.g. behavior change communications for maternal and new-born child health, and agricultural rural advisory and market linkage services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Aggregate</strong> <strong>Supplier</strong> <strong>Mapping:</strong> helps development actors locate potential aggregators based on capability and coverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excel-based source to search for aggregators by country, capability, and which mobile operators they have relationships with</li>
<li>Note: currently focused on Sub-Saharan African region</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Aggregate Demand Model</strong>: gives both development actors and mobile providers an overview of the size of aggregate mobile demand, by country, sector, and use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excel-based business model to size macro-level mobile demand for all mobile channels listed in 1. above, using a standard framework of use cases, population sizing and demand modelling methodologies, focusing on potential aggregate demand if mobile use cases are scaled up.</li>
<li><em>Note: this is not intended to replace field-level estimation of actual historical demand, but a complementary exercise to show the potential of mobile usage in development at national levels</em></li>
</ul>

I am currently a sophomore in Bilkent University, Ankara. And I am a member of IEEE Bilkent Student Branch where I’ve met Andreu in Mobile Days, March 2016. I have spent a month in Lleida, Liquid Galaxy Labs.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my first internship and I feel very lucky that I could come here from Turkey and learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people. As a foreign student, having a practice outside my country has been an incredible experience both because I discovered significant concepts on computer science and practiced my three-week Spanish that I started learning last summer in Malaga. Here in the labs, there are also workshops and events and people with different ideas come and share their projects, opinions, tools and technologies they use. For instance Lot Amoros, the creator of Dronecoria Project for reforestation, shared his ideas and we, students also shared our opinions about what can be done. This has been a very valuable experience due to the project and meeting Lot Amoros himself. We also had a workshop concerning Google Assistant and AIY Voice Kit with the participation of teenagers. We prepared quizzes and flashcards with Actions on Google to use on Google Home and Google Home Mini.<br /><br /> In this four-week period, I experienced open source with Liquid Galaxy. My colleague Oscar Carrasco, also a visiting student from University La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, was able to adapt the Liquid Galaxy to chromebooks for the project, Liquid Galaxy for Education. Now, a team of four including me is working on the Android tablet application that will be used for Liquid Galaxy for Education.<br /><br /><br /> As a foreign computer science student, my stay in Lleida has widened my world by all means, and I thank Andreu Ibáñez for this experience and his hospitality!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>My experience visiting Lleida<br />Oscar Carrasco</b></span><br />My name is Óscar Carrasco and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). <br /><br />I met Andreu in last July, in his TLP Innova conference about Google Summer of Code which really interested me, so I decided to stay in touch with him. We contacted again in November and, one month later, I collaborated with him as a Liquid Galaxy project mentor in the Google Code-in program.<br /><br />This experience was enjoyable to me, so I travelled to Lleida this summer in order to keep developing Open-source software in a project called “Liquid Galaxy for Education”.<br /><br />The first two things that got my attention in Lleida were the blazing hot weather and the lack of sea. Since I’ve been living near the ocean my entire life, it was suffocating not to see it around me. It was hard for me to get used to the climate.<br /><br />The main activity was working in the labs in the morning. We managed to port most of the core Liquid Galaxy features into the Chromebooks during my stance, as it was intended to happen. My partners were also working on improving the legacy Liquid Galaxy Controller Android application during this time.<br /><br />We were also involved in many other tasks. We went to the cinema, had dinner at Punto Estrella, (popular restaurant in Lleida), participated in a local radio channel called UA1, visited a startup called InTech3D and hosted three Google Developer Group meetups in our spare time. And we did all of this in only five days!

        During this summer 2018 and the upcoming first semester of 2018/2019 we're focused on two developments. <br /><b>This is a call for our students and mentors to collaborate on their development.</b><br /><br />The projects tasks coordination will be handled by Deniz Yüksel and Andreu Ibanez, address them for extended information.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E6ur49R0V2A/W0hjkt1ScfI/AAAAAAAGcW8/mA_IEnscCxcNplU4FpEha-kWWBbEqiiWgCLcBGAs/s1600/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="550" data-original-width="1600" height="137" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E6ur49R0V2A/W0hjkt1ScfI/AAAAAAAGcW8/mA_IEnscCxcNplU4FpEha-kWWBbEqiiWgCLcBGAs/s400/LiquidGalaxy%2Bfor%2BEducation%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.png" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Our team of students, residents and visitors,&nbsp;are working hard on the development of the LGxEDU applications. Liquid Galaxy for Chromebooks installation is 90% developed (with the help of Oscar Carrasco), and Android controller application is on his way.<br /><br />Here we want to offer some task related to the integration of the Google Assistant technology in the Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />- <b>Develop a library to connect the Google Assistant</b>, in his Google home form factor, to the Liquid Galaxy.<br />This will consist on a DialogFlow and a webhook that will connect directly to a master computer on a Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />Initially the functionalities we want to see are two:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the Liquid Galaxy to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; places. IE: "Ok Google, go to Izmir, Turkey", for the LG to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; move to Izmir in Turkey.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the camera. IE: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, move forward" to have the camera moved fwd.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, turn right 90 degrees"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or similar actions to implement all the usual movements a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; visitor to a LG installation will do with a Space Navigator<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; joystick.<br /><br />You can see this in action on this video, from student Marcel Porta, showing up the demo he created in 2017 to launch projects on the Liquid Galaxy from a Google Home.<br /><br /><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltqjQC-jMLs" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />In the near future we also want to develop the Google Assistant functionality in the LGxEDU Android app, for launching and playing with the quizes.

        <p>Deploy to AWS EC2 instances using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>So, recently, I’ve been trying to deploy a private repository from GitLab CI/CD pipelines. I couldn’t find an easy way to deploy docker images to EC2 instances. So, I made a workaround of my own using a crazy simple tool we all know of, the <strong>SSH</strong>.</p><p>Through this tutorial, I’m gonna be assuming that you have a working EC2 instance with sudo access to the shell and you already have a docker-compose file ready to set off to production.</p><h4>Setting up EC2 instance</h4><p>SSH into your instance and install docker and docker-compose on it. There are numerous tutorials available online on how to install them. So, I’m not gonna cover that here.</p><p>Once you’ve got them setup, choose a location to place your docker-compose.yml file. Preferably somewhere in /opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt; . So, now, try deploying the compose file directly using docker-compose up -d . Once you’re sure that works, let’s move on to the next step.</p><p>Generate an SSH RSA private/public key pair, that we’re going to use to login from GitLab CI runner and run the deploy script. To generate the key pair, we’ll use ssh-keygen.</p><pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privkey</pre><p>Now, you should have two files, privkey and privkey.pub in your current working directory. Paste the contents of privkey as is (without extra spaces) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance. Copy the contents of privkey.pub , we’ll be using that later from the gitlab CI.</p><h4>Setting up GitLab CI/CD job</h4><p>I’m gonna show an opinionated GitLab CI configuration file, which we’ll be using to build and deploy the images from master branch of the repository.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p68SyHN3hNK0gkXs7554EA.png" /><figcaption>GitLab CI Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, we use the GitLab CI preferences pane, where we’ll setup a few environment variables listed below.</p><ul><li>DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY: The contents of privkey.pub which we generated earlier.</li><li>DEPLOY_SERVER_IP : The IP address of the EC2 instance.</li><li>DEPLOY_HOST : The username of the EC2 instance, eg. ubuntu , if you use a ubuntu base image for setting up EC2 instance.</li></ul><p>Make sure that you’ve turned on the protected flag in the variables section for each of the variables to set them only on protected branches like master.</p><p>From the GitLab CI configuration file, you can see that there is a script .ci/deploy.sh on the repository which we’ll be using to run for deployments. It can be something like this.</p><pre># .ci/deploy.sh</pre><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash<br />set -x -e -o pipefail</pre><pre>COMPOSE_LOCATION="/opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt;/master"<br />DOCKER_GROUP_NAME="docker"</pre><pre># Early checks<br />which docker<br />which docker-compose<br />id -nG | grep "$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME"</pre><pre># Start deployment<br />cd $COMPOSE_LOCATION<br />docker-compose pull<br />docker-compose up -d</pre><p>That’s it, you’re done setting up CD with GitLab.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e215154730f" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f">Ship it!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Los Chromebooks son generalmente portátiles de potencia media y fácil uso con su sistema operativo Chrome OS, bajo coste de adquisición, mantenimiento y gestión, y que están muy orientados al mercado educativo.<br /><br />El software estará compuesto primero por el core Liquid Galaxy instalado en los Chromeboosk bajo Crouton, un software que permite la instalación de Linux muy fácil y rápidamente, y que será ejecutado a la vez que el Chrome OS. Aparte está definiéndose y desarrollándose una aplicación Android para ser ejecutaba en una tableta de 7 a 10", y que dispondrá de los controles del sistema, así como de una aplicación educativa abierta, que vendrá precargada de material educativo para Geografía e Historia y que permitirá a los profesores expandir los contenidos por ellos mismos.<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white;

        <h2 id="how-it-all-began-">How It All Began ?</h2> <p>I had been contributing to <a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit">scancode-toolkit</a> for quite a while and it took me a few months to get accustomed to the codebase. It was the 12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode (the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour since the past couple of months.</p> <p>I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my aspiration. I found <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)</a> which is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of the road, with my friend to check the result and here’s what it displayed:</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance.png" /> </figure> <p>Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the paramount program.</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance_mail.png" /> </figure> <h2 id="whats-next-">What’s next ?</h2> <p>The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have almost completed upgrading the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class and initiated a few bug fixes. I would like to heartily thank my mentors <a href="https://github.com/pombredanne">@pombredanne</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krysnuvadga">@krysnuvadga</a> for keeping faith in me throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX community. I’m super excited to spend this summer with SPDX and intend to use this blog to post updates and developments.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2 id="tldr-why-the-title">TLDR; Why the title?</h2> <p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos. Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p> <ul> <li>I know what I can do: <ul> <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li> <li>Write more regularly.</li> <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li> <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li> <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li> <li>Read more books.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t know what I would do: <ul> <li>Do I go for a job after B.tech? <ul> <li>If yes, then do I need to do something differently from what I am currently doing?</li> </ul> </li> <li>or, I should rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? <ul> <li>If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</li> </ul> </li> <li>and moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me? <ul> <li>Is it lethargy? <ul> <li>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my free time doing these things.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I too busy? <ul> <li>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a few friends, I don’t really do much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not put in enough efforts? <ul> <li>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not have enough resources? <ul> <li>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to advice me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I just slow? <ul> <li>Yes, probably.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2> <p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p> <ul> <li>What stream after High School? <ul> <li>Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</li> <li>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences either.</li> <li>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in other people’s calculation.</li> <li>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What college do you want to go to?</p> <p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for B.Tech program - My rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option. I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2> <p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training. But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into consideration.</p> <p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions” wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes, because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the “optimum” choice.</p> <p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure). The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment” then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p> <p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? - What about MS?</p> <p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be selected, am I too late?</p> <h3 id="solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3> <p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p> <ul> <li>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</li> <li>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</li> <li>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long “thought drills”</li> <li>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely find a way to a solution.</li> </ul> <p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>

        <p>During PyCon India, I had the privilege to meet Sanyam (<a href="https://github.com/CuriousLeaner">@CuriousLeaner</a>), whom I already knew as a mentor to many in the #dgplug community, when he visited the coala community space. We had a short discussion about How to nurture Open Source Communities in college? It was then, when @crancg got him to join the slack for AMU-OSS. And then, one wild day we invited Sanyam to come speak at our college and share his insights on OSS and the following event was born.</p> <p><img alt="Group_Photo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15556382/36986480-eacc15be-20bf-11e8-98d0-9ed9c9331f4b.jpg" /></p> <h2 id="what-happened-there">What happened there?</h2> <h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and Open Source Software</h3> <p>The first part of the session consisted of an introduction to the concept of Free and Open Source Software, and was chaired by Sanyam - the students were made aware of the importance of FOSS in the world. He and the other mentors also took questions and cleared the doubts of students regarding the world of open source.</p> <h3 id="how-to-build-an-add-on-for-mozilla">How to build an Add-on for Mozilla?</h3> <p>The second part of the session was a hands-on technical event, and the students were taught how to implement an add-on (extension) for Mozilla Firefox. The importance of extensions for adding functionality to any browser was stressed, and the students were encouraged to build their own add-ons and to get them published.</p> <h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3> <p>The final part of the event involved the mentors explaining how students could contribute to open source, and how the community was always looking to better itself through the contributions of new and young talent. The talk was inspirational and the students in attendance seemed motivated and encouraged to become a part of the development community.</p> <h2 id="vote-of-thanks">Vote of Thanks</h2> <p>First of all, I would like to thank Sanyam, Shashank and Shivam for coming to the event and inspiring students. A huge shoutout to @crancg for having established AMU-OSS. I would also like to express my gratitude towards Mr. Zafaryab Sir, who is always enthusiastic about such initiatives without whom the event would never have been possible.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Over the past few years I’ve become an avid supporter of FOSS and the open-source community, and it became a goal of mine to start contributing to the open-source world. <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code-In</a> seemed like the perfect opportunity to help me achieve this goal (and much sooner than I thought!), so I signed up without hesitation.</p><p>Once the contest began, I had to choose my first task. I picked a task from <a href="https://coala.io">coala</a> because, well, I thought “coala” was a cute name. coala is a handy tool that can lint and often fix problems in your source code. They have a very helpful guide for newcomers too, making it easy for anyone to get started with contributing.</p><p>My first task was a coding task, but the process of using git and creating tests proved far tougher than writing the main piece of code. I made a lot of mistakes in these areas, and didn’t do things quite the way I should have been doing them, but with some help from my mentors my work was eventually merged, and I had made my first contribution. Success!</p><p>Almost a month later, and I’ve completed an array of different tasks and learnt a ton of new stuff. School, exams and other priorities meant I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I would have liked to Code-In, but I made sure to attempt a variety of different tasks in different areas. Naturally, I encountered difficulties on almost every task — there was a lot of time spent meticulously reading through source code in an attempt to understand things, and I lost count of the number of times I had to ask for extensions. These difficulties are of course key to improving and amongst other things, I’ve finally got the hang of git, I’ve dabbled with graphics and regex for the first time, and (after several run-ins with coala’s linting bears) I’ve learnt to write cleaner and better code.</p><p>But I think the most important things I have learnt come from the experience of working within a real-life organisation. The process I had to go through in order to understand and build upon existing code taught me a lot, and using various tools to complete my tasks has given me valuable practical skills and knowledge that will no doubt be helpful in the future.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful to the mentors at coala for providing very detailed and justified feedback where necessary, answering questions and helping me to resolve any problems. Working with such knowledgeable and friendly people has been extremely rewarding, and I hope to continue contributing to the organisation.</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank Google for making this wonderful experience possible. I’m a little sad that I didn’t find out about GCI sooner as I’ll be too old to participate again next year, but nonetheless, I have had a lot of fun and look forward to diving deeper into the world of OSS!</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba254d19ce28" width="1" />

Well, as you know everyone loves <a href="http://webpack.js.org"><strong>webpack</strong></a> and <a href="https://brunch.io"><strong>brunch</strong></a>. But, this baby 👶 gives a rock solid support for simple things whenever you want it.</p><p>I gotta admit, the zero-config stuff is really enticing. Especially, when you’re just getting started with JavaScript and web development in general. It has built in asset packaging and hot module reloading.</p><p>But, it really is only as powerful as the config-less aproach is. For medium and large scale projects, as everyone would speak out, going for brunch or webpack is the better idea.</p><pre>$ yarn global add parcel-bundler</pre><p>However, getting started with parceljs is as simple as installing parceljs bundler and writing an index page with some javascript.</p><pre>index.html</pre><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br /> &lt;script src="./index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><pre>index.js</pre><pre>console.log('Welcome to parcel.js');</pre><p>Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports <a href="https://parceljs.org/hmr.html">hot module replacement</a> for fast development. Just point it at your entry file:</p><pre>parcel index.html</pre><p>Now open <a href="http://localhost:1234/">http://localhost:1234/</a> in your browser. You can also override the default port with the -p &lt;port number&gt; option.</p><p>Use the development server when you don’t have your own server, or your app is entirely client rendered. If you do have your own server, you can run Parcel in watch mode instead. This still automatically rebuilds as files change and supports hot module replacement, but doesn't start a web server.</p><pre>parcel watch index.html</pre><p>When you’re ready to build for production, the build mode turns off watching and only builds once. See the <a href="https://parceljs.org/production.html">Production</a> 🚀 section for more details.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4958afe5ba3e" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/boilerplates-are-fun-right-4958afe5ba3e">Boilerplates are fun, right?!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>So sometime ago i added a foreign key column as a rails migration which creates an index on that column as well: through the <code>add_foreign_key</code> method. This index is of the form <code>rails_fk_some_hex</code> Unfortunately i forgot to add a unique constraint with the index which was a necessary use case.</p> <p>I thought ‘no big deal’ i’ll just add that now, i ran:</p> <pre>add_index :table_name, :column_name, unique: true, index_name: :some_name</pre> <p>and viola it worked on my local machine like a charm. It even removed the previous index on that column that the foreign key migration created.</p> <p>but running this on staging. I had 2 indexes, 1 unique and 1 non unique -_- .</p> <p><strong>Little debugging and i could confirm a pattern</strong>:</p> <p>If these 2 migrations occur in the same <code>rails db:migrate</code> then the <code>add_index</code> migration also overwrites the index created by the <code>foreign_key</code> migration. However in different migrations, it just adds another index.</p> <p><b>Solution</b>:</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is a feature or a bug. To solve for the cases where migrations run together(dev machines) or on servers where they are run separately I used <code>remove_index</code> if <code>index_exists?</code> .</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>This isn’t something “breaking or a huge discovery”, just something weird i found in my Rails Journey and something you should be aware about.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><br /> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com&amp;blog=108096159&amp;post=383&amp;subd=learningstuffeveryday&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

Every course listed here is either freely available or can be audited free of cost as of January, 2018.</p> <h2 id="projects">PROJECTS:</h2> <p>This is actually the most exciting and important part, as not only do I gain hands on experience on how things work here and the workflow involved, but it also allows me to build a portfolio around automotive technology which, I can then showcase to the potential employers.</p> <p>It is important to take note of the fact that laying down a clear goal of a project before you start it yields better results and agreeably, it’s easy to track progress if you quantify things. For example, if your todo list currently says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be - Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear as possible when posing a project statement.</p> <p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Develop a brain for a self driving car</strong> <ul> <li>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a road scene.</li> <li>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</li> <li>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this neural network.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</strong> <ul> <li>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</li> <li>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a particular road in GTA-5.</li> <li>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A completely self driving RC car</strong> <ul> <li>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</li> <li>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and preferably until battery dies.</li> <li>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</li> <li>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</li> <li>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the curriculum of the various courses.</li> </ul> <h2 id="some-extra-fun-to-dos">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2> <ul> <li>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics</li> <li>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity</li> <li>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</li> <li>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</li> </ul> <p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be! I’ll keep you updated with detailed reports on projects I make.</p>

Many have turned them off completely for that.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5f6"><a href="https://gitmate.io/">We (GitMate.io)</a> are constantly researching about how people handle a flood of incoming issues in our aim to improve the situation by <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gitmate.io/features" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">applying modern technologies</a> to the problem. (Oh and we love free software!)</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0e78">By analyzing the biggest open source repositories on GitHub (more info on the data below) we’ve seen that the contributors to any of those projects responds to only 2.3% of all issues on average. (Let a contributor be a person that commented on at least two issues which they didn’t open.)</p> <figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="f4c5"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div> <div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" height="50" width="75"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R4S6yIEqW1vNJ-S3Xx4R6Q.png" /></div> </div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Contributor Interest Histogram (Summed over the biggest repositories)</figcaption></figure> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="69d5">This makes clear that for any bigger open source project, “Watching” the repository is resulting in a lot of spam for most of the people. If they don’t respond, notifying them was of no value for the discussion after all.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8d2">We can also observe that only very few project managers care for any significant portion of the issues. Only 6 of our human contributors in total care for more than every 5th issue at all. Here’s our heros:</p> <pre class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p" id="dffd">25.05%: golang/go -&gt; ianlancetaylor, Watching 47.48%: moby/moby -&gt; thaJeztah, Watching 27.31%: moby/moby -&gt; cpuguy83, Watching 36.67%: owncloud/core -&gt; PVince81, Not watching 47.12%: saltstack/salt -&gt; gtmanfred, Watching 25.54%: saltstack/salt -&gt; Ch3LL, Watching</pre> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre" id="d310">However, we do see that 29.1% (117) of all contributors (402) are still subscribed to all notifications of the repository (watching it).</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8105">Switching to Polling</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="aef0">Many contributors switch to polling instead of watching the main repository.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a2e">However, we still see that the main maintainers keep watching the repository: without them, it’s very easy to miss out on new issues and it’s hard to make sure that the right people take a look at the right issues in a decentralized system.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f8d0">Introducing Automation</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3a99">In many communities we see home grown bots arising that apply labels and sometimes assign people based on keywords. This works especially well for automatically created issues (e.g. from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentry</a>) but is not a full solution.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e029">We’ve tried it. Contributors started mentioning keywords consciously and it didn’t really work for user reported issues.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="cb2a">Better Automation!</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a947">We wouldn’t be GitMate if we didn’t strive for more. Our data suggests that people are spending way too much time on their notifications. We’ve maintained <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://coala.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">coala.io</a> in the past and we know that reading through all of them is impossible even for core maintainers. Static keyword based automation doesn’t seem to be enough.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="35b4">Since quite a while we’re hacking on an artificial intelligence that helps you dealing with this problem by analyzing exactly what every person in your team is discussing about on GitHub or GitLab and mentioning the ones who are important for solving any new issue.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf53">GitMate is built as a full automated triaging solution. Right now it already mentions related developers in new issues, finds duplicates, labels issues and closes old issues. It is already used by companies like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://owncloud.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ownCloud</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.kiwi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kiwi.com</a>and we’re looking for more beta testers.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf29">If you like this idea, visit <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gitmate.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitMate.io</a> and shoot us an email to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="mailto:lasse@gitmate.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lasse@gitmate.io</a> :).

We only wanted to look at the biggest ones (measured by scraped file size, i.e. roughly amount of text over all issues communicated). We’ve excluded ‘ZeroK-RTS/CrashReports’ because no humans seem to be operating that repository.

        <p>I’ve always loved programming, and doing it socially on GitHub makes things even better. Although I was already a member of several small organizations, such as <a href="https://github.com/gitpoint">GitPoint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Chaosthebot">ChaosTheBot</a> and my local FIRST Robotics Team, this is my first experience working with a really large organizations — in my case, <a href="https://github.com/coala">coala</a>. It’s an amazing experience, so I’m incredibly grateful to <a href="https://g.co/gci">Google Code-In</a> for the opportunity.</p><p>Working with everyone at coala has been fantastic. Not only have I been introduced to a wonderful and powerful code linter (which I’ve already started to implement into my existing code bases), I’ve also learned a ton about Python, unit tests, coala’s commit guidelines and probably most importantly, how to work in a large-scale team environment.</p><p>In the Google Code-In competition, students claim bite-sized “tasks” that usually involve solving a specific bug or adding a feature to one of their organization’s projects. Before “claiming” a task (committing to work on that specific issue) it’s generally good to research how you might go about it and what kinds of external tools or resources might be able to help you. For example, before I claimed a task involving the generation of an RSS feed for one of coala’s websites, I first found an NPM module that could easily create the feed and then read the documentation thoroughly to make sure I understood the module’s usage. At that point, I felt comfortable enough with the technology to claim the task.</p><p>If you are pushing yourself, eventually, you will run into a problem while solving a task. That’s totally fine. The mentors are there to help you overcome any barriers you may come across. I’ve ran into difficulties and had questions about a task several times, but contacting the coala mentors on Zulip or Gitter was very simple, and, after they get back to me quickly, we always work out a good solution. I’m very fortunate to have a huge team of mentors at coala who are willing to provide loads of feedback for even the smallest change, too. Learning directly from professionals in the programming industry has helped me become a better developer and improve my coding habits and abilities.</p><p>If you’re interested in coala, get involved by solving some newcomer issues. Once you’re comfortable, choose tasks in the coala repositories with a higher difficulty. The difficulty system set up in coala repositories is very helpful when you’re just starting off, as all issues are given a rating from newcomer, to low, to medium, to high, and you can pick and choose the issues with a rating you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Overall, coala has given me a stronger appreciation for all open source software, developers and maintainers while also helping me improve my own programming abilities. I’m very happy to be a member of the team and look forward to continuing to work with them well after this year’s Google Code-In competition is complete. Who knows, maybe in a few years I’ll be able to mentor the next generation of coala developers in their Google Code-In journey, and hopefully help them have just as good of a time as I’ve been having.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=174c83855630" width="1" />
