        <p>For over two decades, free and open source software has given us the ability to empower anyone to become collective owners of impactful technology with the freedom to study, change, and share technology solutions for social good. At the Digital Impact Alliance, we strongly believe in what these freedoms can offer to those working in the international development, peacemaking and humanitarian relief sectors. Open source software is an important part of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/">Principles of Digital Development</a>, which is why our <a href="https://www.osc.dial.community/">Open Source Center</a> supports those contributing to and applying this technology in development work.</p>
<p>While open source has long been used in the ICT4D sector, the open source community still faces challenges to represent different demographics despite the movement’s aspiration of inclusiveness and global reach. Given that the codes and algorithms underpinning digital technologies inherently reflect the values and backgrounds of those who build and contribute to them, women’s underrepresentation in open source is a challenge to the community’s commitment to inclusivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover.png"><img class="wp-image-17650 size-medium alignright" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover-229x300.png 229w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover.png 629w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /></a></p>
<p>Recognizing the intersectional nature of this issue, DIAL conducted new research to explore the experiences of women working in open source and better understand why women are underrepresented and do not always feel welcome in this community.</p>
<p>Shared at MozFest 2018, the report entitled <em><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GenderOSS_v10_PDF.pdf">Towards A More Gender-Inclusive Open Source Community</a>, </em>which provides a framework for action, highlights a set of <em>reformist, conformist, and transformist </em>recommendations on how different stakeholders – organizations supporting women in coding, open source communities, employers, conference organizers, governments and funders – can work together to build a more inclusive environment.</p>
<p>This research report is the culmination of a thorough review of the literature, hundreds of hours of dialogue with leaders of, active participants in, and people who have turned away from open source communities. The findings of the research explore how these communities can help reflect the needs of women, provide them with the support they need to be successful and ultimately enable them to contribute to the development of more effective, equitable and inclusive open source products.</p>
<p>We’re eager to share this research and we welcome your feedback on the report and our future work at DIAL’s Open Source Center Forum at  <a href="https://forum.osc.dial.community/">https://forum.osc.dial.community/</a>.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><span>KDevelop 5.3 released</span> <div><p>A little less than a year after the release of KDevelop 5.2 and a little more than <a href="https://frinring.wordpress.com/2018/09/22/happy-20th-anniversary-kdevelop/">20 years after KDevelop's first official release</a>, we are happy to announce the availability of KDevelop 5.3 today. Below is a summary of the significant changes.</p> <p>We plan to do a 5.3.1 stabilization release soon, should any major issues show up.</p> <h2>Analyzers</h2> <p>With 5.1, KDevelop got a new menu entry <em>Analyzer</em> which features a set of actions to work with analyzer-like plugins. For 5.2 the runtime analyzer Heaptrack and the static analyzer cppcheck have been added. During the last 5.3 development phase, we added another analyzer plugin which now is shipped to you out of the box:</p> <h3>Clazy</h3> <p><a href="https://cgit.kde.org/clazy.git/about/">Clazy</a> is a clang analyzer plugin specialized on Qt-using code, and can now also be run from within KDevelop by default, showing issues inline.</p> <p><a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/sites/www.kdevelop.org/files/inline-images/KDevelop%3A%20Clazy%20run%20on%20Okular.png"><img alt="Screenshot of KDevelop with dialog for project-specific Clazy settings, with clazy running in the background" src="https://www.kdevelop.org/sites/www.kdevelop.org/files/inline-images/KDevelop%3A%20Clazy%20run%20on%20Okular.png" width="50%" /></a></p> <p>The <a href="https://cgit.kde.org/kdev-clang-tidy.git/about/">KDevelop plugin for Clang-Tidy support</a> had been developed and released independently until after the feature freeze of KDevelop 5.3. It will be released as part of KDevelop starting with version 5.4.</p> <h2>Internal changes</h2> <p>With all the Analyzers integration available, KDevelop's own codebase has been subject for their application as well. Lots of code has been optimized and, where indicated by the analyzers, stabilized. At the same time modernization to the new standards of C++ and Qt5 has been continued with the analyzers aid, so it can be seen only in the copyright headers KDevelop was founded in 1998 .</p> <h2>Improved C++ support</h2> <p>A lot of work was done on stabilizing and improving our clang-based C++ language support. Notable fixes include:</p> <ul id="ulkdevelop" style="display: block;"><li>Clang: include tooltips: fix range check.

So far Microsoft Windows has been another supported platform, and there is some experimental, but maintainer-seeking support for macOS. Some porters of <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">Haiku</a>, the BeOS inspired Open Source operating system, have done porting as well, building on the work done for other Qt-based software. For KDevelop 5.3 the small patch still needed has been applied to KDevelop now, so the <a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/tree/master/dev-util/kdevelop">Haiku ports recipe for KDevelop</a> no longer needs it.</p> <p>KDevelop is already in the HaikuDepot, currently still at version 5.2.2. It will be updated to 5.3.0 once the release has happened.</p> <p><a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/sites/www.kdevelop.org/files/inline-images/KDevelop%205.3%20Beta%20on%20Haiku.png"><img alt="KDevelop 5.3 Beta on Haiku" src="https://www.kdevelop.org/sites/www.kdevelop.org/files/inline-images/KDevelop%205.3%20Beta%20on%20Haiku.png" width="50%" /></a></p> <h2>Note to packagers</h2> <p>The Clazy support as mentioned above has a recommended optional runtime dependency, clazy, more specifically the clazy-standalone binary. Currently clazy is only packaged and made available to their users by a few distributions, e.g. Arch Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed or OpenMandriva,</p> <p>If your distribution has not yet looked into packaging clazy, please consider to do so. Next to enabling the Clazy support feature in KDevelop, it allows developers to easily fix and optimize their Qt-based software, resulting in a less buggy and more performant software again for you.</p> <p>You can find more information in the the <a href="https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-announce-apps/2018-September/005477.html">release announcement</a> of the currently latest clazy release, 1.4.</p> <h2>Get it</h2> <p>Together with the source code, we again provide a prebuilt one-file-executable for 64-bit Linux (AppImage), as well as binary installers for 32- and 64-bit Microsoft Windows. You can find them on our <a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/download">download page</a>.</p> <p>The 5.3.0 source code and signatures can be downloaded from <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/kdevelop/5.3.0/src/">here</a>.</p> <p>Should you find any issues in KDevelop 5.3, please let us know in the <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&amp;product=kdevelop">bug tracker</a>.</p> </div> <span><span lang="" xml:lang="">kossebau</span></span> <span>Wed, 2018/11/14 - 10:00</span> <div> <div>Category</div> <div> <div><a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/news" hreflang="en">News</a></div> </div> </div> <div> <div>Tags</div> <div> <div><a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/taxonomy/term/28" hreflang="en">release</a></div> <div><a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/taxonomy/term/96" hreflang="en">5.3</a></div> </div> </div> <section></section>

Wikipedia subsequently received <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nobel-prize-winner-physics-2018-donna-strickland-wikipedia-entry-deleted-sexism-equality-a8572006.html">justifiable</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/10/08/why-nobel-winner-donna-strickland-didnt-have-wikipedia-page/">criticism </a>for its low percentage of female editors, its editing culture, and its <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/18/wikipedia-mirror-world-gender-biases/">replication of the world&#8217;s systemic biases</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this coverage included little about more mundane problems encountered by editors who are trying to document academics and academic fields on Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, and of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics">130,000+ volunteers</a> who edit the English Wikipedia on any given month, the majority are not academic experts. They lack sources to cite and photos to use for the articles they want to write, and they don&#8217;t always know where to find them.</p>
<p>This is where academics can step in to help and ensure there are Wikipedia articles documenting the achievements of the next generation of Donna Stricklands. Contributing to Wikipedia is rewarding, but it can be a significant commitment of time and effort.  It&#8217;s important to have Wikipedia events at your institution, but there are plenty of other ways you can help that don&#8217;t involve one-off editing events:</p>
<h3>1. Write about your field on Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Follow the examples of future doctor <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/03/07/the-keilana-effect/">Emily Temple-Wood </a>and Dr. <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/07/13/jess-wade/">Jess Wade</a> and take stewardship of the articles in your field. Write or contribute to articles on important people and topics in your area of expertise and encourage your colleagues to do so as well. Members of numerous organizations, from the American Chemical Society to the National Women&#8217;s Studies Association, are already engaged with Wikipedia articles in their relevant academic domains.</p>
<h3> 2. Have your students write about your field on Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Encourage your students to do so as well, perhaps in the form of classroom assignments. The non-profit organization <a href="https://wikiedu.org/">Wiki Education Foundation</a> provides curricular and technical assistance to hundreds of college courses each semester whose students are contributing to Wikipedia as part of their coursework. Students who reluctantly write papers for an audience of one respond positively when presented with the opportunity to contribute to a globally-accessible web of knowledge.</p>
<h3>3. Critique an article in your field</h3>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the time or inclination to contribute to Wikipedia, you can still help Wikipedia by critiquing an article.  For example, Karen Lemmey, a curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, offered <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American-art-museum-karenlemmey-lecture-thegreekslave.webm">a brief critique</a> of the Wikipedia article on the sculpture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek_Slave"><em>The Greek Slave</em></a>.  This critique, recorded by Professor Andrew Lih and made available on Wikipedia, provided direction for his American University students to significantly improve that Wikipedia article.  If you’d like to do this yourself, you don&#8217;t have to go to the trouble of making a video—you can simply leave a few quick comments and sources on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages">&#8220;talk&#8221; page</a>, a discussion page for each article you can reach by clicking on the &#8220;talk&#8221; tab, to help Wikipedia editors with your expertise.</p>
<h3>4. Document the important people in your field</h3>
<p>There are other ways your expertise can help. Write and publish biographies documenting important colleagues and their contributions to your field.  Biographical articles about academics, especially if they are in a peer-reviewed journal, are one of the most important and useful sources a editor can draw on to write a Wikipedia article. The lack of these sources are a major reason why Wikipedia articles on academics like Donna Strickland don&#8217;t get written or get deleted. Consider contributing and publishing these kinds of profiles in your field&#8217;s journals if they aren&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>Even if these articles exist, they might not be accessible to most editors. For example, the journal <em>American Psychologist </em>publishes numerous short biographical articles about award winners and other major contributors to the field, but if you try to read them on the web, you&#8217;ll be confronted with a pay-wall charging you $11.95 to read each one. Unless a Wikipedia editor is affiliated with an academic library that subscribes to <em>American Psychologist, </em>they won&#8217;t be able to read that profile and a Wikipedia article on that particular academic likely won&#8217;t get written. Even if your journal isn&#8217;t open access, consider making these types of articles open-access to facilitate the creation of Wikipedia articles on people in your field.</p>
<h3>5. Photograph the important people in your field</h3>
<p>Writing isn&#8217;t the only way you can contribute to Wikipedia. We often hear complaints that many Wikipedia articles lack photographs of their subjects, but we simply can&#8217;t grab photos off the web. Like Wikipedia&#8217;s written content, almost all photos we use* must be freely licensed and reusable.  Wikipedia editors do their best to find, create, and contribute as many photos as they can. For example, Wikimedia District of Columbia volunteers go to events like the National Book Festival to take <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:2018_National_Book_Festival">photos of people for their Wikipedia articles</a>.</p>
<p>Academics can contribute in the same way. Document your conferences and colleagues and put the photos on Flickr or Wikimedia Commons.  Remember that we can only use freely licensed photos that can be redistributed, and non-commercial licenses prevent their use on Wikipedia. For example, the American Library Association does a fantastic job of providing photos of their conferences and leading contributors to our field. Unfortunately, they post them on Flickr with a non-commercial license, so many Wikipedia articles about important librarians, including about half of the most recent presidents of the ALA, lack photographs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that Wikipedia isn&#8217;t something created in a factory somewhere by people you&#8217;ll never meet. It&#8217;s the encyclopedia anyone can edit, and that includes you too. Scholarly communication shouldn&#8217;t be limited to conferences, journals, and your students.  Come help Wikipedia volunteers as they assemble the world&#8217;s most widely-used and largest information resource.</p>

        <p>Elisa (<a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Elisa">product page</a>, <a href="https://mgallienkde.wordpress.com/">release announcements blog</a>) is a music player designer for excellent integration into the KDE Plasma desktop (but of course it runs everywhere, including some non-Free platforms). I had used it a few times, but had not gotten around to packaging it. So today I threw together a FreeBSD port of Elisa, and you&#8217;ll be able to install it from official packages whenever the package cluster gets around to it.</p> <p><a href="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot_20181113_140614.png"><img alt="Screenshot of pkg info for Elisa" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2000" height="150" src="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot_20181113_140614-150x150.png" width="150" /></a>I say &#8220;threw together&#8221; because it took me only a half hour (most of that was just building it a half-dozen times in different ways). The Elisa code itself is very straightforward and nice. It doesn&#8217;t even spit out a single warning with Clang 6 on FreeBSD. That&#8217;s an indicator (for me, anyway) of good code. So if you want more music on FreeBSD, it&#8217;s there! (And the multimedia controls work from the SDDM lock screen, too)</p>

I&#8217;m from the UK and mostly known as a fanartist.</p> <h3>Do you paint professionally, as a hobby artist, or both?</h3> <p>I have had a few commissions but outside that I would call myself a hobbyist. I would love to work professionally at some point.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8706" height="992" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/colinstitan-800.png" width="800" /></p> <h3>What genre(s) do you work in?</h3> <p>I do semi-realistic sci-fi art. I most recently I have been drawing character portraits inspired from the Art Nouveau style, the majority of it has been fanart of a few different Sci-fi games.</p> <h3>Whose work inspires you most &#8212; who are your role models as an artist?</h3> <p>It&#8217;s hard to list them all really. Top of the list would be my other half, RedSkittlez, who is an amazing concept and character artist, also my friends Blazbaros, SilverBones and many more that would cause this to go on for too long.</p> <p>Outside of my friends I would say Charles Walton, Pete Mohrbacher and Valentina Remenar to name a few.</p> <h3>How and when did you get to try digital painting for the first time?</h3> <p>About 4 years ago I downloaded GIMP as I wanted to get back into art after not drawing for about 15 years. I got a simple drawing tablet soon after and things just progressed from there.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8705" height="1131" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/arcsoul-800.png" width="800" /></p> <h3>What makes you choose digital over traditional painting?</h3> <p>The flexibility and practicality of it. Whilst I would love to try traditional acquiring, maintaining and storing supplies is not easy for me.</p> <h3>How did you find out about Krita?</h3> <p>My partner was looking at alternatives to photoshop and came across it via a youtube video. He recommended me to try it out.</p> <h3>What was your first impression?</h3> <p>How clean the UI is and how all of the tools where easy to find, and the fun I had messing with the brushes.</p> <h3>What do you love about Krita?</h3> <p>The fact it was really easy to get to grips with, yet I can tell there is more I can get from it. Also the autosave.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8708" height="1133" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gtfo-campain-posterfinal-800.png" width="800" /></p> <h3>What do you think needs improvement in Krita? Is there anything that really annoys you?</h3> <p>I would like a brightness/contrast slider alongside the curve for ease of use. It would also be nice if the adjustment windows would not close when the autosave kicks in.</p> <h3>What sets Krita apart from the other tools that you use?</h3> <p>I have not used many programs before I can across Krita. But the thing that jumped out at me was the ease of use and it had everything I wanted in an art program, I know that if I want to try animation I do not need to go and find another program.</p> <h3>If you had to pick one favourite of all your work done in Krita so far, what would it be, and why?</h3> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8709" height="1083" src="https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Saladin&#8217;s-White-Wolf-800.png" width="800" /></p> <p>That is hard to say, but in a pinch I would say the one titled &#8220;Saladin&#8217;s White Wolf&#8221;. I was really happy how the background came out, it was also the one to be picked out and promoted by Bungie on their twitter.</p> <h3>What techniques and brushes did you use in it?</h3> <p>For the most part I use a multiply layer over flats for shading. My main brushes are just the basic tip (gaussian), basic wet soft and the soft smudge brush.</p> <h3>Where can people see more of your work?</h3> <p>Over on my DeviantArt page: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/holdxtorevive">https://www.deviantart.com/holdxtorevive</a><br /> And my twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/HoldX2ReviveART">https://twitter.com/HoldX2ReviveART</a></p> <h3>Anything else you&#8217;d like to share?</h3> <p>I&#8217;m bad with words but I want to show appreciation to the Krita crew for making this wonderful program and to everyone who has supported and encouraged me.</p>

        <h3>Getting started &#8211; clang-tidy AST Matchers</h3> <p>Over the last few weeks I published some blogs on the Visual C++ blog about <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchers.html">Clang AST Matchers</a>. The series can be found here:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/19/exploring-clang-tooling-part-1-extending-clang-tidy">Extending clang-tidy</a> <li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/23/exploring-clang-tooling-part-2-examining-the-clang-ast-with-clang-query">Examining the clang AST with clang-query</a> <li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/11/06/exploring-clang-tooling-part-3-rewriting-code-with-clang-tidy">Rewriting code with clang-tidy</a> </ul> <p>I am not aware of any similar series existing which covers creation of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> checks, and use of <tt>clang-query</tt> to inspect the Clang AST and assist in the construction of AST Matcher expressions. I hope the series is useful to anyone attempting to write <tt>clang-tidy</tt> checks. Several people have reported to me that they have previously tried and failed to create <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions, due to various issues, including lack of information tying it all together.</p> <p>Other issues with <tt>clang-tidy</tt> include the fact that it relies on the &#8220;mental model&#8221; a compiler has of C++ source code, which might differ from the &#8220;mental model&#8221; of regular C++ developers. The compiler needs to have a very exact representation of the code, and needs to have a consistent design for the class hierarchy representing each standard-required feature. This leads to many classes and class hierarchies, and a difficulty in discovering what is relevant to a particular problem to be solved. </p> <p>I noted several problems in those blog posts, namely:</p> <ul> <li><tt>clang-query</tt> does not show AST dumps and diagnostics at the same time&lt; <li>Code completion does not work with <tt>clang-query</tt> on Windows <li>AST Matchers which are appropriate to use in contexts are difficult to discover <li>There is no tooling available to assist in discovery of source locations of AST nodes </ul> <p>Last week <a href="http://codedive.pl/index/speaker/name/stephen-kelly">at code::dive in Wroclaw</a>, I demonstrated tooling solutions to all of these problems. I look forward to video of that talk (and videos from the rest of the conference!) becoming available. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll publish some blog posts here showing the same new features in <tt>clang-query</tt> and <tt>clang-tidy</tt>.</p> <h3><tt>clang-query</tt> in Compiler Explorer</h3> <p>Recent work by the Compiler Explorer maintainers adds the possibility to use source code tooling with the website. The compiler explorer contains new entries in a menu to enable a <tt>clang-tidy</tt> pane.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1598" style="width: 460px;"><img alt="clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer" class="size-full wp-image-1598" height="258" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/compiler-explorer-new-tool.gif?w=450&#038;h=258" width="450" /><p class="wp-caption-text">clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer</p></div> <p>I demonstrated use of compiler explorer to use the <tt>clang-query</tt> tool at the code::dive conference, building upon the recent work by the compiler explorer developers. This feature will get upstream in time, but can be used with <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/HHJGIi">my own AWS instance for now</a>. This is suitable for exploration of the effect that changing source code has on match results, and orthogonally, the effect that changing the AST Matcher has on the match results. It is also accessible via <a href="http://cqe.steveire.com">cqe.steveire.com</a>.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Compiler Explorer is running <tt>clang-query</tt> in script mode, so it can process multiple <tt>let</tt> and <tt>match</tt> calls for example. The new command <tt>set print-matcher true</tt> helps distinguish the output from the matcher which causes the output. The <tt>help</tt> command is <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/Z-O3tm">also available</a> with listing of the new features.</p> <p>The issue of <tt>clang-query</tt> not printing both diagnostic information and AST information at the same time means that users of the tool need to alternate between writing</p> <pre> set output diag </pre> <p>and</p> <pre> set output dump </pre> <p>to access the different content. Recently, I committed a change to make it possible to enable both output and diag output from <tt>clang-query</tt> at the same time. New commands follow the same structure as the <tt>set output</tt> command:</p> <pre> enable output dump disable output dump </pre> <p>The <tt>set output &lt;feature&gt;</tt> command remains as an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; setting to enable only one output feature and disable all others.</p> <h3>Dumping possible AST Matchers</h3> <p>This command design also enables the possibility of extending the features which <tt>clang-query</tt> can output. Up to now, developers of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions had to inspect the AST corresponding to their source code using <tt>clang-query</tt> and then use that understanding of the AST to create an AST Matcher expression.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599" height="295" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/allenabled.png?w=450&#038;h=295" width="450" /></p> <p>That mapping to and from the AST &#8220;mental model&#8221; is not necessary. New features I am in the process of upstreaming to <tt>clang-query</tt> enable the output of AST Matchers which may be used with existing bound AST nodes. The command</p> <pre> enable output matcher </pre> <p>causes <tt>clang-query</tt> to <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/Y66i1P">print out all matcher expressions</a> which can be combined with the bound node. This cuts out the requirement to dump the AST in such cases.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1600" height="295" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/all-no-ast.png?w=450&#038;h=295" width="450" /></p> <p>Inspecting the AST is still useful as a technique to discover possible AST Matchers and how they correspond to source code. For example if the <tt>functionDecl()</tt> matcher is already known and understood, it can be dumped to see that function calls are represented by the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CallExpr.html">CallExpr</a> in the Clang AST. Using the <tt>callExpr()</tt> AST Matcher and dumping possible matchers to use with it leads to the discovery that <tt>callee(functionDecl())</tt> can be used to determine particulars of the function being called. Such discoveries are not possible by only reading AST output of <tt>clang-query</tt>.</p> <h3>Dumping possible Source Locations</h3> <p>The other important discovery space in creation of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions is that of Source Locations and Source Ranges. Developers creating extensions must currently rely on the documentation of the Clang AST to discover available source locations which might be relevant. Usually though, developers have the opposite problem. They have source code, and they want to know how to access a source location from the AST node which corresponds semantically to that line and column in the source.</p> <p>It is important to make use a semantically relevant source location in order to make reliable tools which refactor at scale and without human intervention. For example, a cursory inspection of the locations available from a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1FunctionDecl.html">FunctionDecl</a> AST node might lead to the belief that the return type is available at the <tt>getBeginLoc()</tt> of the node.</p> <p>However, this is immediately challenged by the C++11 trailing return type feature, where the actual return type is located at the end. For a semanticallly correct location, you must currently use </p> <pre> getTypeSourceInfo()-&gt;getTypeLoc().getAs().getReturnLoc().getBeginLoc() </pre> <p>It should be possible to use <tt>getReturnTypeSourceRange()</tt>, but <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39567">a bug in clang</a> prevents that as it does not appreciate the trailing return types feature.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" height="270" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/functiondecl_loc.png?w=450&#038;h=270" width="450" /></p> <p>Once again, my new output feature of <tt>clang-query</tt> presents a solution to this discovery problem. The command </p> <pre> enable output srcloc </pre> <p>causes <tt>clang-query</tt> to <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/2DN-mh">output the source locations by accessor and caret</a> corresponding to the source code for each of the bound nodes. By inspecting that output, developers of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions can discover the correct expression (usually via the clang::TypeLoc heirarchy) corresponding to the source code location they are interested in refactoring.</p> <h3>Next Steps</h3> <p>I have made many more modifications to <tt>clang-query</tt> which I am in the process of upstreaming. My Compiler explorer instance is listed as the &#8216;clang-query-future&#8217; tool, while the clang-query-trunk tool runs the current trunk version of clang-query. Both can be enabled for <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/SiyGHJ">side-by-side comparison</a> of the future <tt>clang-query</tt> with the exising one. </p>

      <h5>2018-11-11T10:52:38.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Sandro Knauß (hefee)</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>You have probably read a lot about Akademy 2018 recently, and how great it was. <br /> For me it was a great experience too and this year I met a lot of KDE people, both old and new. This is always nice. <br /> I arrived on Thursday so I had one day to set everything up and had a little bit of time to get to know the city. <br /> On Friday evening I enjoyed the "Welcoming evening", but I was very surprised when Volker told me that I would be on stage the next day, talking about privacy. <br /> He told me that someone should have informed me several days before. The scheduled speaker, Sebastian, couldn't make it to Akademy.</p> <p>That was really a pity. If I had known earlier, I would have prepared a proper presentation, as I think I have a lot to say on the topic. I care a lot about good encryption support in KDE PIM and I have also been busy with <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails, a distribution strongly focused on privacy and anonymity</a>.</p> <p>So the next day I rambled a bit about encrypting mail headers (also known as <a href="https://github.com/autocrypt/memoryhole">Memory Hole</a>), but it wasn't a great talk. It was also very stressful, as we started with a lot of delay: Setting up the audio took much longer than expected so all talks started late. As I was in such a hurry. I forgot a lot of what I wanted to say and failed to draft a greater picture for the privacy goal.</p> <p>To compensate, let me say it here. Privacy starts with encrypting everything, starting with the content of the connection. This is mostly done via TLS. Here KDE is lacking some bits, as we cannot display the encryption methods, so we are sometimes forced to downgrade to old and insecure encryption methods without user visual feedback. But at least we support TLS everywhere! Unfortunately metadata is often enough to track where people are. To hide this information, we need TOR/VPN support within the applications. For most applications you can use the TOR network by running</p> <pre><code>torsocks &lt;cmd&gt; </code></pre> <p>but this is not really user-friendly. <br /> It also has the disadvantage that you can't see if DNS requests are transmitted via the TOR tunnel. And then there's deamons, which you don't normally run from the command line. Furthermore, e.g. GnuPG has an option to enable TOR support and does not like to run using torsocks.</p> <p>We need more control over the used TLS certificates and a way to display the TLS parameters, like accepted ciphers, protocol versions etc. Because at the moment KDE just asks you about unknown certificates, but you can't view/ control the other important details of a TLS connection to harden your system. Sure a default user can't decide whether something is good or not and a user may need to access some rotten company side. But we can provide a rating like ssllabs to show that the TLS connection is not good.</p> <p>Another topic is to have a good support for TOR/VPN for applications and KDE in total in a user friendly way. And be sure that everything within these applications really uses the tunnel. I think at usecases like: I want TOR for everything except this application. After we have good solutions for those, we can focus on all the different applications. I haven't a good overview what each application should do in regards to the Privacy goal additionally. <br /> As I'm busy within KDE PIM I see some things there:</p> <ul> <li>Encrypting headers of mails to give less metadata to surveillance <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/T742">T742</a>.</li> <li>Make it possible to search in encrypted mails. Until now, the encrypted data are a binary blob to the search. The search is important to find mails again and is often a reason, why users do not use encrypted messages. <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/T8447">T8447</a>.</li> <li>Protect Akregator webviewer against ad trackers <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/T7528">T7528</a>.</li> <li>Add GnuPG TOFU (Trust On First Use) trust model support for KMail. With TOFU you will get more security without exchanging the gpg fingerprints. To make it clear, exchanging fingerprints gives more security than is achieved with TOFU, but it is exhausting. Only a small number of users exchange fingerprints. So many users will profit from having extra security by the TOFU security model being supported by KMail.</li> </ul> <p>To move forward in reaching the privacy goal, I volunteered to organize a Sprint together with Louise Galathea. It will hopefully take place next Spring.</p> <p>But back to the Akademy - two days of many talks which was pretty overwhelming, in a good way. I really enjoyed the mix of non technical talks and technical talks. My highlight was a talk about <a href="https://conf.kde.org/en/Akademy2018/public/events/56">Kontact from Markus Feilner</a>. It is interessting to see how users master issues around Kontact and what solutions they find. The talk would have benefited from Markus talking to KDE PIM before, as some of his suggestions weren't correct. But it was nice to see that there are happy users who love all bells and whistles from Kontact. The days after the talk I encountered another user who gave Kontact a try after years, because of that talk.</p> <p>The BOF session started on Monday. I started the Mondey joining the Promo BoF to get some insights into how Promo works and how KDE PIM can have better promotion to attract new contributors. Together we created a rough plan to focus first on the new website and then create several blog posts to promote KDE PIM. Internaly we started to create several junior jobs and are discussing who can mentor new people when they come along. This is still ongoing and hopefully new people will join the new spirit of KDE PIM and aren't overwhelmed by the big amount of repositories.</p> <p>After the AGM I joined the Distros BoF and was impressed by how many Distros have a KDE focus. We started to talk about issues regarding KDE and downstream. Especially if distros are time based, they need a lot of manpower to validate if bugs have already been fixed upstream, or if it is a downstream bug. The fast release cycle of different KDE bundels (Plasma, Frameworks &amp; Applications) makes it even more difficult to follow. Maybe this BoF helps the distros to talk more about their issues in the distributions@kde.org mailinglist directly and solutions can be found for common issues.</p> <p>The next day I attend KConfig BOF and talked about issues reagarding config migration and how to store config. Also a very common issue is that you need to get updates of config values in your application. KDE PIM has some examples of bad decisions reagarding config handeling, as you can configure a lot of stuff and everything is seperated into several files. But the seperation is not well formed from the beginning - an issue that's grown with the years. It is also written down as task to do cleanups and make the configs easier to consume. Because a clearer seperation also helps users who want to move their KDE PIM from one computer to another.</p> <p>In the afternoon, the KDE PIM BoF took place, where we followed up on what has been going on since the last Akademy and what new things we want to do. We discussed a lot of how we can improve the onbording for KDE PIM. <br /> As we want to make it easier for other applications to use PIM related data, we have a long standing goal to move single parts of KDE PIM to Frameworks. For the next KDE Application 18.12 we want to push syndication into Frameworks release. If we would have more manpower, we would move those things faster to Frameworks. If you are interested, or currently using some parts of KDE PIM within your application, it is a good idea to help us getting things cleaned up and moved to Frameworks. A bigger audience can consume PIM data more easily.</p> <p>In the evening I joined the LGBT &amp; Quuer Dinner and it was nice to cook together and chat.</p> <p>The next days I mostly sat down and tried to get some smaller things fixed, like the issue with the <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=397441">suspend icon within the logout Applet</a>. It is very good to sit next to Kai-Uwe so he could see and propose workarounds directly. Finally he found the hard coded color in the theme and the issue is solved in the next release.</p> <p>Since there were many open discussions I did not managed to write a line of code within these days - I was busy talking. Additionally I wanted to see the newest KDE PIM within Debian, so this also took some time. </p> <p>On Friday I took a train back to Germany. As Volker is always interested about live data from delays for improving KItinerary, he wished me some delays. And I had a lot of delay - I arrived in Berlin 12h later than expected. I had to sleep in Dresden, as the last train from Prag leaves at 18:07 towards Berlin. And since I missed that one, I had to take a local train to Dresden and there was no train anymore to Berlin. And it wasn't really late - just midnight. I never thought about that Dresden is that badly connected to rest of Germany... <br /> But it was nice as I stayed at a friends place, who I wouldn't have met otherwise. From the improving KItinerary it was not a success, as I only got one update from Deutsche Bahn at 23:25 - telling me that the train from Leipzig to Berlin would use another track. The more useful information, that I never would reach that train would be more useful.</p>

        <p>C++ comparison operators are usually fairly straightforward to implement. Writing them by hand can however be quite error prone if there are many member variables to consider. Missing a single one of them will still compile and mostly work fine, apart from some hard to debug corner cases, such as misbehaving or crashing algorithms and containers, or data loss. Can we do better?</p> <h3 id="background">Background</h3> <p>In <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/">KItinerary</a> we have a number of classes representing <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> types. Those are fairly straightforward value types with a number of properties, to be consumed both statically (by C++ code) and dynamically (by QML, Grantlee and JSON-LD de/serialization).</p> <p>As implementing getters, setters, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Q_PROPERTY</code> statements, member variables, etc for about a hundred or so properties by hand would result in an unreasonable amount of boilerplate code, this is all done by a macro (<a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/browse/master/src/datatypes/flight.h">example</a>).</p> <p>So far so good, but now we&#8217;d like to add comparison operators for those types. Specifically we needed <code class="highlighter-rouge">operator==</code> for optimizing away some memory allocations in case of non-changing write operations (similar to the common pattern of not emitting change signals in setter methods on non-changes). But the thoughts below are of course also applicable to any other comparison function, not just equality.</p> <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3> <p>Ideally we&#8217;d find an alternatives to writing the comparison functions by hand that would either be impossible to break or would at least not fail silently (e.g. by producing compiler errors).</p> <h4 id="qmetaproperty">QMetaProperty</h4> <p>One idea would be to implement the comparison functions entirely generically by leveraging the property iteration support in <code class="highlighter-rouge">QMetaObject</code>. That is we iterate over all properties with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">STORED</code> flag and compare their values. This gets the job done, but has two drawbacks:</p> <ul> <li>Comparison happens via <code class="highlighter-rouge">QVariant</code>, which means we have to register comparison operators for all types with the meta type system. That might actually be nice to have anyway, but it is limited to less-than and equal.</li> <li>All property values are passed through <code class="highlighter-rouge">QVariant</code>, which in some situations can have a relevant performance impact, in particular when using types that are too large for inline storage inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">QVariant</code> (causing allocations).</li> </ul> <h4 id="more-preprocessor-magic">More preprocessor magic</h4> <p>Another idea could be to use more elaborate preprocessor constructs that allow for iteration over all properties. The <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/preprocessor/doc/index.html">Boost.Preprocessor</a> library has the building blocks for this. From experience in an old pre-C++11 <a href="https://github.com/kdab/sqlate">project attempting to catch SQL errors at compile time</a> this works but doesn&#8217;t really lead to a nice syntax nor easily maintainable code.</p> <h4 id="a-clever-overloading-trick-from-verdigris">A clever overloading trick from Verdigris</h4> <p>The solution I ended up using is inspired by Woboq&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/woboq/verdigris">Verdigris</a>. The basic idea is that each property macro generates a part of the comparison function only, the comparison for its property and a call to the comparison function for the previous property. The chaining is done by overloading on a template type that essentially describes a numerical value by inheritance. A little <code class="highlighter-rouge">constexpr</code> helper functions allows us to determine the index of a property at compile time. Olivier describes this in more detail in his <a href="https://woboq.com/blog/verdigris-implementation-tricks.html">blog post about Verdigris implementation details</a>.</p> <p>The resulting code for KItinerary can be found <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/source/kitinerary/browse/master/src/datatypes/datatypes_p.h">here</a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that while this might look inefficient due to the many function calls, this is all inline code in a single translation unit, so in an optimized build this ends up essentially as the hand-written comparison function would look like.</p> <h3 id="language-support">Language support?</h3> <p>Would it make sense to have C++ support something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">bool operator==(const T&amp;) const = default</code>, that is let the compiler generate the implementation for us, as it can for a number of other member functions? <a href="http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4126.htm">Proposals</a> for such a language extension exist.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a bigger conceptual problem though, that one runs immediately into once the comparison operator is implemented: the semantics of comparing things. Here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Floating point numbers: how close together is &#8220;equal&#8221; depends on what those numbers represent, in my case of geo coordinates anything within a few meters is certainly more than enough. And there is the little detail that <code class="highlighter-rouge">NAN</code> does not compare equal to itself, which isn&#8217;t what KItinerary needed either, as NAN is its indicator for &#8220;value not set&#8221;.</li> <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">QString</code>: here the default equal comparison doesn&#8217;t distinguish between null and empty strings. That&#8217;s probably very often what you&#8217;d expect, unless you put special semantics on that distinction, such as in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">NAN</code> case above.</li> <li>Date/time values: two <code class="highlighter-rouge">QDateTime</code> instances compare equal if they refer to the same point in time, not if they represent exactly the same information (e.g. time specified with an UTC offset vs a full IANA timezone). For KItinerary timezones are a very crucial information, so the default semantic doesn&#8217;t cut it there.</li> </ul> <p>An all-or-nothing approach for compiler-generated comparison operator implementations means it&#8217;s not a viable option in case one needs more control over the semantics. That of course does not mean it is useless, but it does mean the alternative implementation techniques remain valid either way.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-09T17:41:38.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Saskia Ehlers, Houssem Abida and Ed Erhart</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_heterosexuality">compulsory heterosexuality</a>? This concept described how heterosexuality is assumed, enforced and viewed as an obligation regardless of one’s own sexual preferences, and it was the subject of one of the articles that members of the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_LGBT%2B/Portal">LGBT user group</a> wrote about in different languages in Stockholm, Sweden, last August.</p>
<p>The event was organized by a group of Wikimedians coming from Asia, Africa, and Europe, all united by one single cause: promoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> Culture and achievements online. For four days in August, 12 participants took part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europride">EuroPride</a> 2018 in Stockholm. In two days of editing, the participants created, translated, and improved over 80 LGBT-related Wikipedia articles in more than 10 languages, in addition to adding over 300 photos. They also participated in a human rights summit, and the user group walked in a pride parade for the first time. For some participants, it was the first time they had the chance to walk in a pride parade in their life, as they don&#8217;t exist in their home countries.</p>
<p>The meeting gave LGBT user group members the opportunity to meet and exchange their personal experiences both inside and outside the Wikimedia movement. They also strategized about how they could support one another through an international network. Next year, two similar events will be organized in Vienna for EuroPride and New York for World Pride.</p>
<p>We talked with two organizers of the Stockholm event: Houssem Abida and Saskia Ehlers. If you&#8217;d like to contribute to making the flag more visible on Wikipedia, join the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Loves_Pride">Wiki Loves Pride</a> initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the current state of LGBT content on Wikipedia? Where is it strong, and where is it weak?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Houssem Abida</strong>: I think LGBT content needs a lot of work on Wikipedia, especially in some specific languages. For example, you can find articles that cover almost all sexual concepts in English, but it is very hard to find them in Arabic. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_king">drag kings</a> are a very basic concept in LGBT culture, but they didn&#8217;t exist on the Arabic Wikipedia before the Stockholm edit-a-thon.</p>
<p>Also, many important activists are still not showcased enough through the platform; it is our role to write about them.</p>
<p>That said, I think a strong point of Wikipedia is that it gives a relatively good and updated general overview of the situation LGBT people are living in every country (through the articles &#8220;LGBT in X&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>How does the emerging <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017">Wikimedia 2030</a> strategy fit with improving coverage of LGBT topics on Wikipedia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Houssem Abida: </strong>I think the strategy is very supportive to our case and in fighting for it. For example, the way it emphasizes partnerships is very important for us and makes our work stronger and structured (NGOs provide references and documents, help with logistics, help us access difficult communities, etc.). Also, focusing on local communities is something we need, as it provides us with deeper communication channels and allows to reach a bigger and more vulnerable community (when it comes for the sexual education role that Wikipedia plays, for example).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>What gave you the idea to combine EuroPride with peace advocacy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>This is a somewhat longer story. My grandparents met through a peace organization after World War II. They took part in workcamps where they rebuilt churches and houses with teams of young people from different countries that had previously been at war. The intention of those kinds of exchanges and organizations was for the participants to get to know each other&#8217;s cultures and become friends, so that it would in the future it would not be possible to blindly hate and slaughter people just because they had another nationality, culture, or spoke another language.</p>
<p>When the time came I became active in such an organization as well. I was a camp leader and organizer in Germany and other countries. Through that I met Thomas Schallhart from Austria, who was like me active within the Wikimedia movement and the same peace organization. We decided to combine both passions in the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/13/digest-wikipedia-for-peace/">Wikipedia for Peace</a> project. In this, young people from different countries came together to write about a certain peace related topic on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I had organized a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_for_Peace_Madrid_World_Pride">LGBT-related Wikimedia event in Madrid in 2017</a> because the World Pride took place there then. It was truly great and very fruitful, so I wanted to repeat this in Stockholm—and as Thomas had lived in Sweden for several years, we had the necessary connections to make that idea a reality.</p>
<p>The reason why we see writing about LGBT issues as a topic suitable for the Wikipedia for Peace format is that aside from nationality, culture, and language barriers, people are also excluded or hated because of their sexual preferences. Both Thomas and I have experienced that personally. This format gives us the chance to spread knowledge in different language versions, and through education create tolerance and awareness. In Madrid, for example, participants wrote the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_language">Kyrgysz</a> Wikipedia article on sexual diversity. On the other hand people can have human exchanges and gain understanding through this. One thing that I can think about here is how one person in Madrid described how and why they had bullied homosexuals in their youth, and how the phenomenon is very present in their culture until today. That same person continued to work on the topic after the event was finished. I think that these events and sharing experiences with very different people can change a person&#8217;s mind and life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide what topics to cover at the Stockholm edit-a-thon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>People had different ideas on what to write about, so at the end we covered a wide variety of topics. One person for example promised to their bisexual friend that they would write about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphobia">biphobia</a> in their language as there is sometimes discrimination within the LGBT community towards bisexuals. Another person who is a doctor in real life wrote about sex change surgery. We had a reflection round each day and talked about what each person wrote about during the day. So people also gave each other ideas and influenced each other on what to write about. We also had input in terms of talks from participants. In one talk different gender concepts from all over the world were mentioned, which led one participant to write about the Southern Mexican concept for the third gender Muxe. We took part in the human rights summit in which important activists and speakers from different countries were present. One of them was Sedef Çakmak who was the first openly gay politician to be elected into office in Turkey. Some people wrote about her in their language versions. We also took a picture of her at the summit, which is now included in her article.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>Have you run into any difficulties? If so, what?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s somewhat difficult to finance and organize such international exchanges through Wikimedia funds. Conference grants don&#8217;t really fit because the projects are designed to be low budget. Travel costs can only be reimbursed from chapters with a lot of money for community support, such as Germany, Switzerland or Austria. All of means that it is a lot harder for people from poorer countries or regions with no user groups or chapters to participate. This made the financing and logistics somewhat difficult and time consuming. A rapid grant alone is not sufficient to cover the flights, accommodation, and food costs during the event. Another kind grant to organize such exchanges like a European fund would be great. We proposed this idea at Wikimania in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Aside from that we&#8217;d like to thank the Austrian, German and Swedish chapter for the financial and in kind support of the event.</p>

Dave had 3D-printed a KDE logo we stuck to the top of the monitor, and had a pile of leaflets and stickers (KDE, neon, Krita, GCompris, and some Wiki To Learn) to hand out.</p> <p>Next to our stand was <a href="https://www.minetest.net/">MineTest</a>, with a demo and they sat hacking at the code of the game for most of the weekend. On the other side, <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> themselves were handing our IRC.horse stickers and other goodies.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1992" style="width: 160px;"><a href="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/conference.jpg"><img alt="Photo of Dave talking with people" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1992" height="150" src="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/conference-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The hallway track</p></div> <p>A conference booth isn&#8217;t just about giving away goodies, though, and we spent the weekend, 9-to-5, talking with people about the KDE community and its software products. Plasma could be seen &#8212; and played with &#8212; on the machines we had at hand, and we did some small application demo&#8217;s. As usual, people told us they used i3 &#8212; and our response as usual is that Free Software on the desktop is better than non-free software. Some people had last used KDE in 2010 or so, so we could show how the different parts now operate independently and more flexibly &#8212; and how Plasma is now pretty darn lightweight.</p> <p>Here in the photo is Dave extolling the virtues of something. (I&#8217;ve edited the photo to make some people in the background un-recognizable by pasting Dave&#8217;s eyeball over their faces &#8212; I forgot to ask permission to post)</p> <div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1996" style="width: 160px;"><a href="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-source-business.jpg"><img alt="Photo of stage with presentation" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1996" height="150" src="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/open-source-business-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Conference track</p></div> <p>.. and a conference isn&#8217;t just about the booths and vendor stands, either. It&#8217;s about the talks. Here&#8217;s one I sat in on about business models and how licensing affects the available models (in particular with reference to recent license changes in some projects). The KDE community is interesting because it&#8217;s not one-community-one-company like a lot that I see. We have a collection of small and medium companies building on, and building with, the KDE community&#8217;s software products. I think that&#8217;s healthy and generally happy. No licensing gotcha&#8217;s for us when using Qt under the LGPL version 2.1 and KDE&#8217;s Frameworks also under the LGPL.</p> <p>Two talks I would like to single out are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znkhCbnGuXU">Leslie Hawthorn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV9Vt4knqsc">VM Brasseur</a>, (those are YouTube links). Neither are technical talks, but social talks, about what we (as Free Software contributors) do and why, and social issues we all face &#8212; and how to bring Software Freedom to more people.</p> <p>A concept I didn&#8217;t know existed was <em>platform shaming</em>. See above: there&#8217;s lots of ways to use Free Software from the KDE community, in combination with i3, or on Windows, and on Free Software operating systems. Those are all OK.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1993" style="width: 160px;"><a href="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dave-at-work.jpg"><img alt="Photo of Dave with laptop" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1993" height="150" src="https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dave-at-work-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bugfixing Dave</p></div> <p>I&#8217;d like to thank Dave for being a great booth- room- and dinner-mate, and Christel and the Freenode#live crew for a wonderful well-organized weekend.

The next milestone is to kill the running process on exit making Kdenlive almost as stable as the Linux version.</p> <p>In other news, we are organizing a bug squash day on the first days of December.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I was in the third year of my CS graduation course when I started exploring Open Source communities and Fedora in particular. As someone who was completely new to almost everything, it was tough to get started. After creating my FAS ID back in September 2015, I remained a spectator for the next few months all the while trying to find some ground. At the end of my semester, April 2016, I decided to take action and joined the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CommOps group</a> &#8211; my first step towards being a Fedora contributor. I dropped by at one of the meetings and that&#8217;s when I met Justin and Remy.

He also helped me with an IRC bouncer which I very much rely on for all my communication related to Fedora. He always has this positive energy around him and his zeal to always do more for the community really inspires me. We, in CommOps, always joke around about Justin having minions to help out with all his tasks because he is always ahead of everyone in the team.

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Have you ever wanted to test if your application works on ARM, but don&#8217;t want to make an image and launch a real device, or wanted to test an architecture you don&#8217;t even have hardware for?&#160;I have been following a set of instructions I have gathered from various online sources, and have been teaching others how to do the same, but I want to collect it all here and publish it here for you to follow as well. While writing this I will be following the instructions myself for an architecture I haven&#8217;t done this for before.</em></p> <p>The secret is of course QEMU, but to make testing easier I will set it up so that QEMU doesn&#8217;t simulate an entire system, but runs foreign applications as if they were native inside my existing X11 desktop. This is possible through the qemu-user binaries, which can run statically linked executables or dynamically linked ones if you are in a properly set up chroot.</p> <h2>Setting up chroot</h2> <p>So how do you get this properly set up chroot? There are various ways depending on the Linux distro. I personally use Debian, and the instructions here will be almost identical to what is done on Ubuntu. If you use Suse or RedHat, I know you can find official guidelines on setting up a chroot for qemu.</p> <p>First, get the dependencies&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> apt-get install binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static debootstrap<br /> </code></p> <p>Most of these are just the tools needed, and binfmt-support is configuration glue what will make Linux launch ELF executables with non-native architectures using qemu, which is another piece of the magic puzzle.</p> <p>For my example I am testing while writing this, I will be targeting the IBM mainframe architecture S/390x and will also need the cross-building tools for that as well. I can get all of those on Debian by just pulling in the right cross-building g++ (as root or sudo) :<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> apt-get install g++-s390x-linux-gnu<br /> </code></p> <p>S/390x is interesting for me because Debian dropped official support for big endian PPC64, so I need a new way of testing that Qt works on 64bit big-endian platforms.</p> <p>Now go to where you want your sysroots installed, and run debootstrap. Debootstrap is the Debian tool for downloading and installing a Debian image into a sub-directory<br /> (as root or sudo) :<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> debootstrap stable --arch s390x stable debian-s390x http://deb.debian.org/debian/<br /> </code></p> <p>Next prepare it for being a chroot system&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> mount --rbind /dev debian-s390x/dev/<br /> mount --rbind /sys debian-s390x/sys/<br /> mount --rbind /proc debian-s390x/proc/<br /> </code></p> <p>Enter the chroot&#160;(as root or sudo) :<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> chroot debian-s390x<br /> </code></p> <p>If you run &#8216;uname -a&#8217; here you will now get something like:<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> Linux hostname 4.x.x-x-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.x.x-x (2018-x-x) s390x GNU/Linux<br /> </code></p> <p>In other words, a native AMD64 kernel with x390x userland! Every command you execute here will be using s390x binaries in the chroot, but using the native kernel for system calls. If you launch an X11 app, it will be using the X11-server running natively on your machine already.</p> <h2>Prepare chroot to be a sysroot</h2> <p>To build Qt, we also need all the Qt dependencies inside the chroot. In Debian we can do that using &#8216;apt-get build-dep&#8217;.</p> <p>Edit debian-s390x/etc/apt/sources.list and add a deb-src line, such as: <code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stable main<br /> </code></p> <p>Install the Qt dependencies (inside chroot as root):<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> apt-get update<br /> apt-get build-dep qtbase-opensource-src<br /> </code></p> <p>Finally, for the setup we need to make sure it works a sysroot for cross-building by replacing absolute links to system libraries with relative ones that work both inside and outside the chroot&#160;(inside chroot as root):<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> apt-get install symlinks<br /> cd /usr/lib/<br /> symlink -rc .<br /> </code></p> <h2>Building Qt</h2> <p>We can now build Qt for this sysroot. If you want to test you own applications, you could also install&#160;an official prebuilt Qt version from Debian, and build against that.</p> <p>Configuring Qt for cross-building to a platform like that looks like this on Debian, and only needs a few changes to work on other platforms: <code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> $QTSRC/configure -prefix /opt/qt-s390x -release -force-debug-info \<br /> -system-freetype -fontconfig -no-opengl \<br /> -device linux-generic-g++ -sysroot /sysroots/debian-s390x \<br /> -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/s390x-linux-gnu-<br /> </code></p> <p>You can remove the -no-opengl argument if you want to test OpenGL using the mesa software implementation, but otherwise I don&#8217;t recommend using OpenGL inside the chroot.</p> <p>If everything is setup correctly you don&#8217;t need to specify &#8216;-system-freetype -fontconfig&#8217;. It is just there to catch failures in pkg-config, so we don&#8217;t end up building a Qt version that requires manually bundling fonts.</p> <p>In general cross-compiling with Qt always looks similar to the above, but note that if you are cross-building to ARM32, it looks a little bit different: <code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> $QTSRC/configure -prefix /opt/qt-armhf -release -force-debug-info \<br /> -system-freetype -fontconfig -no-opengl \<br /> -device linux-arm-generic-g++ -sysroot /sysroots/debian-armhf \<br /> -device-option DISTRO_OPTS=hard-float \<br /> -device-option COMPILER_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon' \<br /> -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-<br /> </code></p> <p>Notice that ARM32 has a specific device name (linux-arm-generic-g++ instead of linux-generic-g++) and needs to have a floating-point mode set. Additionally, for older embedded architectures, it is generally a good idea to specify COMPILER_FLAGS to select a specific architecture. You need to pass compiler flags as a device-option, because the normal way of specifying QMAKE_CFLAGS and QMAKE_CXXFLAGS after configure options sets the host compiler flags, not the target compiler flags. If you need more complicated options, you should make your own qmake device target. You can always base it of linux-generic-g++ for good defaults.</p> <p>With Qt configured like this, you can build it as usual and run make install to have the libraries installed into the /opt directory under the chroot.</p> <p>Issue encountered; as I built qtbase, I hit a linking error: <code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> qt5/qtbase/src/corelib/global/qrandom.cpp:143: error: undefined reference to 'getentropy'<br /> </code></p> <p>The problem turns out to be that my cross-building tools have libc6 2.27 while the sysroot has libc6 2.24. The best thing to do would be using the same libc version on both sides. However, as they are fully compatible, except for newer features in one, I chose to just disable this feature in Qt. I accomplished this by&#160;calling the configure command again, this time with -no-feature-getentropy added.</p> <p>With this change, everything I tried building built and installed without further issues.</p> <h2>Run a Qt application</h2> <p>To get some examples to test, go to the folder of the example in the build tree and run &#8216;make install&#8217;. For instance, my standard example for widgets: <code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> cd qtbase/examples/widgets/richtext/textedit<br /> make install<br /> </code></p> <p>Then&#160;(inside chroot as root, assuming you have created a testuser):<code style="font-size: 90%;"><br /> su - testuser<br /> export DISPLAY=:0<br /> export QT_XCB_NO_MITSHM=1<br /> /opt/qt-s390x/examples/widgets/richtext/textedit/textedit -platform xcb<br /> </code></p> <p>And it just works&#8230;<br /> The -platform xcb argument is needed because the default for embedded builds is using the eglfs QPA. I am assuming you are developing on X11 and want the jaw-dropping experience of having a foreign architecture Qt application just launch like a normal Qt app.</p> <p>In this setup, the applications running in QEMU will be much faster than under a full system emulation, because the kernel and the X11 server are still the native ones, and thus running at normal speed.&#160;However,&#160;for X11 it means sometimes having a few oddities, as there can be client-server mismatch in endianness. While it is supposed to be supported, it is such an edge case that it often has issues. This is the reason why QT_XCB_NO_MITSHM=1 is set. Otherwise, we would hit an issue with passing file descriptors between client and server, which is likely a bug in libxcb. If we were testing a little-endian architecture like arm64 or riscv instead, the environment variable would not be needed.</p> <p>So that is it, quite a few steps, but most only done once. And as I wrote this, I followed the same instructions for a rather uncommon and not officially supported platform, and only hit two issues with easy work-arounds.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/09/testing-qt-emulated-architectures-using-qemu-user-mode/" rel="nofollow">Testing Qt on Emulated Architectures Using QEMU User Mode</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blog.qt.io" rel="nofollow">Qt Blog</a>.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>We had an in-person meeting at the <a href="https://upf.edu/web/mtg"><abbr title="Music Technology Group">MTG</abbr></a> during the <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit/18">MetaBrainz summit</a> to discuss the status and future of <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org/">AcousticBrainz</a>. We came up with a rough outline of things that we want to work on over the next year or so. This is a small list of tasks that we think will have a good impact on the image of AcousticBrainz and encourage people to use our data more.</p>
<h2>State of AcousticBrainz</h2>
<p>AcousticBrainz has a <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org/statistics-graph">huge database of submissions</a> (over 10 million now, thanks everyone!), but we are currently not using the wealth of data to our advantage. For the last year we’ve not had a core developer from MetaBrainz or MTG working on existing or new features in AcousticBrainz. However, we now have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/paramsingh">Param</a>, who is including AcousticBrainz in his role with MetaBrainz</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rsh7">Rashi</a>, who <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/">worked on AcousticBrainz for <abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GSoC</abbr></a> and is going to continue working with us</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/philtgun">Philip</a>, who is starting a PhD at MTG, focused on some of the algorithms/data going into AcousticBrainz</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alastair">Alastair</a>, who now has more time to put towards management of the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, we&#8217;re glad to present an outline of our next tasks for AcousticBrainz:</p>
<h2>Short-term</h2>
<p>Some small tasks that are quick to finish and we can use to show off uses of the data in AcousticBrainz</p>
<h3>Merge Philip’s similarity, including an API endpoint</h3>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1479769">Philip’s masters thesis</a> project from last year uses PostgreSQL search to find acoustically similar recordings to a target recording. This uses the features in AcousticBrainz. We need to ensure that PostgreSQL can handle the scale of data that we have.</p>
<p>An extension of this work is to use the similarity to allow us to remove bad duplicate submissions (we can take all recordings with the same MBID and see if they are similar to each other, if one is not similar we can assume that it’s not actually the same as the other duplicates, and mark it as bad). We want to make these results available via an API too, so that others can check this information as well.</p>
<h3>Merge Existing PRs</h3>
<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pulls">many great <abbr title="pull requests">PRs</abbr></a> from various people which Alastair didn’t merge over the last year. We&#8217;re going to spend some time getting these patches merged to show that we’re open to contributions!</p>
<h3>Publish our Existing models</h3>
<p>In research at MTG we’ve come up with a few more detailed genre models based on tag/genre data that we’ve collected from a number of sources. We believe that these models can be more useful that the current genre models that we have. The AcousticBrainz infrastructure supports adding new models easily, so we should spend some time integrating these. There are a few tasks that need to be done to make sure that these work</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that high-level dumps will dump this new data (If we have an existing high-level dump we need to make a new one including the new data)</li>
<li>Ensure that we compute high-level data for all old submissions (we currently don’t have a system to go back and compute high-level data for old submissions with a new model, the high-level extractor has to be improved to support this)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Update/fix some pages</h3>
<p>We have a number of issues reported about unclear text on some pages and grammar that we can improve. Especially important are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/AB-373">API description</a> (we should remove the documentation from the main website and just have a link to <a href="https://acousticbrainz.readthedocs.io/">the ReadTheDocs page</a>)</li>
<li>Front page (Show off what we have in the project in more detail, instead of just a wall of text)</li>
<li>Data page (instead of just showing tables of data, try and work out a better way of presenting the information that we have)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fix Picard plugin</h3>
<p>When AB was down during our migration we were serving HTML from our API pages, which caused Picard to crash if the AB plugin was enabled while trying to get AB data. This should be an easy fix in the Picard plugin.</p>
<h2>High Impact</h2>
<p>These are tasks that we want to complete first, that we know will have a high impact on the quality of the data that we produce.</p>
<h3>Frame-level data</h3>
<p>We want to extract and store more detailed information about our recordings. This relies on working being done in MTG to develop a new extractor to allow us to get more detailed information. It will also give us other improvements to data that we have in AB that we know is bad. This data is much bigger than our current data when stored in JSON (hundreds of times larger), so we need to develop a more efficient way of storing submissions. This could involve storing the data in a well-known binary data exchange format. A bunch of subtasks for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the essentia extractor software</li>
<li>Decide on how to store items on the server (file format, store on disk instead of database)</li>
<li>Work out a way to deal with features from two versions of the extractor (do we keep accepting old data? What happens if someone requests data for a recording for which we have the old extractor data but not the new one?)</li>
<li>Upgrade clients to support this (Change to HTTPS, change to the new API URL structure, ensure that clients check before submission if they’re the latest version, work out how to compress data or perform a duplicate check before submission)</li>
<li>Deduplication (If we have much larger data files, don’t bother storing 200 copies for a single Beatles song if we find that we already have 5-10 submissions that are all the same)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MusicBrainz Metadata</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/">Rashi’s GSoC project</a> in 2018 helped us to replicate parts of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz. This allows us to do amazing things like keep up-to-date information about MBID redirects, and do search/browse/filtering of data based on relationships such as Artists just by making a simple database query. We want to merge this work and start using it.</p>
<h3>Dumps</h3>
<p>When we changed the database architecture of AcousticBrainz in 2015 we stopped making data dumps, making people rely on using the API to retrieve data. This is not scalable, and many people have asked for this data. We want to fix all of the outstanding issues that we’ve found in the current dumps system and start producing periodic dumps for people to download.</p>
<h3>Build more models</h3>
<p>In addition to the existing models that we’ve already built (see above, “Publish our Existing models”), we have been collecting a lot of metadata that we could use to make even more high-level models which we think will have a value in the community. Build these models and publicly release them, using our current machine learning framework.</p>
<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<p>These are tasks that we want to complete that will show off the data that we have in AcousticBrainz and allow us to do more things with the data, but should come after the high-impact tasks.</p>
<h3>Expose AB data on MusicBrainz</h3>
<p>As part of the process to cross-pollinate the brainz’s, we want to be able to show a small subset of AB data that we trust on the MB website. This could include information such as <abbr title="beats per minute">BPM</abbr>, Key, and results from some of our high-level models.</p>
<h3>Improve music playback</h3>
<p>On the detail page for recordings we currently have a simple YouTube player which tries to find a recording by doing text search. We want to improve the reliability and functionality of this player to include other playback services and take advantage of metadata that we already have in the MusicBrainz database.</p>
<h3>Scikit-learn models</h3>
<p>The future of machine learning is moving towards deep learning, and our current high-level infrastructure written in the custom Gaia project by MTG is preventing us from integrating improved machine learning algorithms to the data that we have. We would like to rewrite the training/evaluation process using <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, which is a well known Python library for general machine learning tasks. This will make it easier for us to take advantage of improvements in machine learning, and also make our environment more approachable to people outside the MusicBrainz community.</p>
<h3>Dataset editor improvements</h3>
<p>Part of the high-level/machine learning process involves making datasets that can be used to train models. We have a basic tool for building datasets, however it is difficult to use for making large datasets. We should look into ways of making this tool more useful for people who want to contribute datasets to AcousticBrainz.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>With the integration of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz, we will be able to let people search for metadata related to items which we know only exist in AcousticBrainz. We think that this is a good way for people to explore the data, and also for people to make new datasets (see above). We also want to provide a way that lets people search for feature data in the database (e.g. “all recordings in the key of Am, between 100 and 110BPM”).</p>
<h3>API updates</h3>
<p>As part of the 2018 MetaBrainz summit we decided to unify the structure of the APIs, including root path and versioning. We should make AcousticBrainz follow this common plan, while also supporting clients who still access the current API.</p>
<p>We should become more in-line with the MetaBrainz policy of API access, including user-agent reporting, rate limiting, and API key use.</p>
<h3>Request specific data</h3>
<p>Many services who use the API only need a very small bit of information from a specific recording, and so it’s often not efficient to return the entire low-level or high-level JSON document. It would be nice for clients to be able to request a specific field(s) for a recording. This ties in with the “Expose AcousticBrainz data on MusicBrainz” task above.</p>
<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>Fix all our bugs and make AcousticBrainz an amazing open tool for MIR research.</p>

During the day there&nbsp;were a series of conferences whose purpose was to&nbsp;show this distribution and&nbsp;define the main features of Linux.</p>

<span id="more-6510"></span>

<p>The meetings had&nbsp;as&nbsp;the following objectives:</p>

<p>&#8211; discuss the importance of Free Software and Open Source;</p>

<p>&#8211; provide a general introduction to GNU / Linux and to&nbsp;the various distributions, in particular Fedora&#8217;s one.</p>

<p>More in detail, the speakers discussed and presented&nbsp;topics of general nature such as file system, file system structure and the organization of folders, passwords and security, as well as the management of utilities and permissions.</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned topics&nbsp;mentioned,&nbsp;given the interest shown, we moved on to more technical subjects,&nbsp;where elements such as&nbsp;user applications, <code>rpm</code>, and <code>dnf</code>&nbsp;were explained</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-6513" srcset="https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01.jpeg 4160w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://1504253206.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FWD3-01-766x511.jpeg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px" /><figcaption>Ruggero Lot presenting user applications, rpm and dnf on Fedora Women&#8217;s Day 2018 at Mittelab (Trieste)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Then the participants shared dinner in good company with an excellent pizza and discussed the topics&nbsp;dealt with&nbsp;further. At the end of the&nbsp;day the Install party took place and the participants installed the Fedora operating system on their computers, thanks to the collaboration of the Mittelab members.</p>

<p>We are especially satisfied with the enthusiasm and the involvement showed by the participants, despite a moderate participation of women.</p>

        <p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 11.1, 10.6, 9.6.11, 9.5.15, 9.4.20, and 9.3.25. This release fixes one security issue as well as bugs reported over the last three months.</p> <p>All users using the affected versions of PostgreSQL should update as soon as possible. Please see the notes on "Updating" below for any post-update steps that may be required if you are using <code>pg_stat_statements</code> in your installation.</p> <p>This update is also the final release for PostgreSQL 9.3, which is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes. If your environment still uses PostgreSQL 9.3, please make plans to update to a community supported version as soon as possible. Please see our <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Security Issues</h2> <p>One security vulnerability has been closed by this release:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16850">CVE-2018-16850</a>: SQL injection in <code>pg_upgrade</code> and <code>pg_dump</code>, via <code>CREATE TRIGGER ... REFERENCING</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Versions Affected: 10, 11</p> <p>Using a purpose-crafted trigger definition, an attacker can run arbitrary SQL statements with superuser privileges when a superuser runs <code>pg_upgrade</code> on the database or during a pg_dump dump/restore cycle. This attack requires a <code>CREATE</code> privilege on some non-temporary schema or a <code>TRIGGER</code> privilege on a table. This is exploitable in the default PostgreSQL configuration, where all users have <code>CREATE</code> privilege on <code>public</code> schema.</p> <h2>Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2> <p>This update also fixes numerous bugs that were reported in the last several months. Some of these issues affect only version 11, but many affect all supported versions.</p> <p>These releases include fixes that:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure that automatically created child indexes are created in the same tablespace as the parent partitioned index</li> <li>Fix several crashes with triggers</li> <li>Fix problems with applying <code>ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS</code> to a partitioned temporary table</li> <li>Fix how <code>NULL</code> values are handled when using <code>LEFT JOIN</code> with a parallelized hash join</li> <li>Several fixes around using named or defaulted arguments in <code>CALL</code> statements</li> <li>Fix for strict aggregate functions (i.e. aggregates that cannot accept <code>NULL</code> inputs) with ORDER BY columns that enforces the strictness check</li> <li>Fix with <code>CASE</code> statements where an expression was cast to an array type</li> <li>Disable an optimization for updating expression indexes in order to prevent a crash</li> <li>Fix a memory leak that occurred on a specific case of using a SP-GiST index</li> <li>Fix for <code>pg_verify_checksums</code> incorrectly reporting on files that are not expected to have checksums</li> <li>Prevent the PostgreSQL server from starting when <code>wal_level</code> is set to a value that cannot support an existing replication slot</li> <li>Ensure that the server will process already-received NOTIFY and SIGTERM interrupts before waiting for client input</li> <li>Allow PL/Ruby to work with newer versions of PostgreSQL</li> <li>Fix for character-class checks on Windows for Unicode characters above U+FFFF, which affected full-text search as well as <code>contrib/ltree</code> and <code>contrib/pg_trgm</code></li> <li>Fix a case where <code>psql</code> would not report the receipt of a message from a <code>NOTIFY</code> call until after the next command</li> <li>Fix build problems on macOS 10.14 (Mojave)</li> <li>Several build fixes for the Windows platform</li> </ul> <p>This updates also contains tzdata release 2018g for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Morocco, and Russia (Volgograd), plus historical corrections for China, Hawaii, Japan, Macau, and North Korea.</p> <h2>PostgreSQL 9.3 is End-of-Life (EOL)</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 9.3 is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes.

        <p>Jings no wonder people find computer programming scary when the most easily accessible lanugage, JavaScript, is also the most messy one.</p> <p>Occationally people would mention to me that the categories on Planet KDE didn&#8217;t work and eventually I looked into it and it mostly worked but also sometimes maybe it didn&#8217;t.&#160; Turns out we were checking for no cookies being set and if not we&#8217;d set some defaults for the categories.&#160; But sometimes the CDN would set a cookie first and ours would not get set at all. This was hard to recreate as it didn&#8217;t happen when working locally of course.&#160; And then our JavaScript had at least three different ways to run the initial-setup code but there&#8217;s no easy way to just read a cookie, madness I tell you.&#160; Anyway it should be fixed now and set categories by default but only if it hasn&#8217;t set some before so you may still have to manually choose which you read.</p> <p>In the Configure Feed menu at the top you can select to read blogs in different languages.&#160; By default it shows only blogs in English, as well as Dot News, Project News and any User blogs who have asked to be added (only two are listed in our config).&#160; You can also show blogs in Chinese (also only 2 listed), Italian (none listed), Polish (one), Portugese (two), Spanish (four but kdeblog by Jose is especially prolific) or French (none).&#160; Work to be done includes working out how to make this apply to the RSS feed.</p><p><a href="http://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/planetkde.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898" height="439" src="http://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/planetkde.png" width="827" /></a></p><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F07%2Fplanet-kde-categories%2F&#038;t=Planet%20KDE%20Categories&#038;s=100&#038;p&#091;url&#093;=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F07%2Fplanet-kde-categories%2F&#038;p&#091;images&#093;&#091;0&#093;=http%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2Fplanetkde.png&#038;p&#091;title&#093;=Planet%20KDE%20Categories" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px;

        <p>DUBLIN – Yesterday afternoon, the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) and NetHope convened a group of donor and implementing government and non-governmental organizations to discuss shared challenges and opportunities to work more closely together in 2019. The group committed to initiating a dialogue aimed at investing more time and resources together to identify ways organizations can collectively work towards the goal of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of digital solutions for development to reach more people across the globe.</p>
<p>Executives from several NetHope member organizations joined donors from US and European agencies to discuss broad areas of potential collaboration, including strategies to increase integration; joint methods of promoting greater inclusion; common strategies to drive leveraged investment; and practical methods where they can promote more responsible data policies so that new technologies equally benefit and protect the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
<p>“Technology continues to advance at an increasing rate but has been slow to reach many in the developing world,” said Kate Wilson, CEO of the Digital Impact Alliance. “Only through strong collaboration and information sharing between all actors in the digital development ecosystem can we ensure anyone, anywhere at any time can access life-enhancing services enabled by digital technology.”</p>
<p>The four challenge areas discussed by the donor and implementing organizations are reflected in DIAL’s latest report: “<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/resource/donor-organizations-the-principles-for-digital-development-a-landscape-assessment-and-gap-analysis/">Donor Organizations &amp; the Principles for Digital Development: A Landscape Assessment and Gap Analysis</a>.” The report provides a snapshot of the current capacity within donor organizations and recommendations on how development impact can be improved through the more effective use of technology and digital methodologies, including adoption and practice of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/">Principles for Digital Development.</a></p>
<p>“The Digital Principles are a cornerstone for development organizations who are using technology to improve outcomes,” said Dr. Dirk Aßmann, Director General of Sectoral Department at GIZ.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the donor and implementing organizations, Dr. Aßmann shared the pledge made to work more closely together in 2019 to support the recommendations made in the new DIAL report and deliver more value for money working with partners.</p>
<p>“Digital technology, when used well, is a key tool to more effectively and efficiently deliver better development outcomes,” said Lauren Woodman, CEO of NetHope. “Working together, DIAL and NetHope are committed to a robust, ongoing dialogue with the goal of bringing donors, implementing organizations, and technology providers together in partnership to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I’m a FLOSS and Linux user for more than 15 years now. I had never been in a community, even if sometimes I marginally contributed to some open source projects, mainly in translation or in bug reporting. There were various reasons: my chronic lack of free time, and the fear to be totally unuseful due to the fact that there is so many skilled people inside these projects.</p><p>My first Linux distribution was Red Hat Linux 6, back in 1999. Then Fedora Core, but in the subsequent years I was a so called distro hopper, at least on my laptops. Last year I decided to go back to the origins, and install Fedora again. I was surprised by the clean and ease installation process, compared to the past (and compared to other distros). Looking at the wiki and to other project’s sites, I felt like contributing to the Fedora Project was simple and newcomers were welcome. Then I subscribed to various mailing lists, looking to a place where my little skills could be useful.</p><p>The continuation of the story may appear totally unrelated to Fedora. In fact, in the meanwhile, at work I was involved in a project related to a captive portal for a wifi network, and I needed to send some SMS to foreign phone numbers in order to test the registration page. I’m not an international guy, and I have not friends outside my country (in reality yes, a former colleague that lives in Brazil, but it was unavailable at the time). So, in some messages coming from some Fedora mailing list, at the bottom of the emails of a very active contributor I saw a mobile number. I privately contacted him using Hangout, by telling him my needs. He was so kind that I thought that all the people of the Fedora community might be so collaborative and nice. And in fact I’m still impressed by the commitment of a lot of members in avoiding toxic behavior and how important is to maintain an healthy community.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Alciregi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessio</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributor-stories#6</a></cite></blockquote>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Some years ago I added an embedded Twitter feed to the side of Planet KDE.&#160; This replaced the earlier feed manually curated feeds from identi.ca and twitter which people added but had since died out (in the case of identi.ca) and been blocked (in the case of Twitter).&#160; That embedded Twitter feed used the #KDE tag and while there was the odd off topic or abusive post for the most part it was an interesting way to browse what the people of the internet were saying about us.&#160; However Twitter shut that off a few months ago which you could well argue is what happens with closed proprietary services.</p> <p>We do now have a <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@kde">Mastodon</a> account but my limited knowledge and web searching on the subject doesn&#8217;t give a way to embed a hashtag feed and the critical mass doesn&#8217;t seem to be there yet, and maybe it never will due to the federated-with-permissions model just creating more silos.</p> <p>So now I&#8217;ve added a manually curated Twitter feed back to Planet KDE with KDE people and projects.&#160; This may not give us an insight into what the wider internet community is thinking but it might be an easy way to engage more about KDE people and projects as a community.&#160; Or it might not, I haven&#8217;t decided yet and I&#8217;m happy to take feedback on whether it should stay.</p> <p>In the mean time ping me to be added to the list or subscribe a bug on <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?component=Twitter%20Feed&amp;list_id=1562244&amp;product=Planet%20KDE&amp;resolution=---">bugs.kde.org</a> to request you or someone you know or or your project be added (or removed).&#160; Also volunteers wanted to help curate the feed, ping me to help out.</p><a class="synved-social-button synved-social-button-share synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F06%2Fplanet-kde-twitter-feed%2F&#038;t=Planet%20KDE%20Twitter%20Feed&#038;s=100&#038;p&#091;url&#093;=https%3A%2F%2Fjriddell.org%2F2018%2F11%2F06%2Fplanet-kde-twitter-feed%2F&#038;p&#091;images&#093;&#091;0&#093;=&#038;p&#091;title&#093;=Planet%20KDE%20Twitter%20Feed" rel="nofollow" style="font-size: 0px;

        <p>Welcome to Part 4 of my Blog series about Sharing Files to and from mobile Qt Apps.</p> <p><a href="http://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/12/01/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app/">Part 1</a><a href="http://blog.qt.io/blog/2017/12/01/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app/">&#160; </a>was about sharing Files or Content <strong>from</strong> your Qt App <strong>with</strong> native Android or iOS Apps,<br /> <a href="http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/01/16/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app-part-2/">Part 2</a>&#160;explained how to share Files <strong>with&#160;</strong>your Qt App <strong>from&#160;</strong>other native <strong>Android&#160;</strong>Apps,<br /> <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/02/06/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app-part-3/">Part 3</a>&#160;covered sharing Files <strong>with&#160;</strong>your Qt App <strong>from&#160;</strong>other native <strong>iOS&#160;</strong>Apps.<br /> Part 4 implements <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html">FileProvider</a>&#160;to share Files&#160;<strong>from&#160;</strong>your Qt App <strong>with&#160;</strong>native <strong>Android</strong>&#160; Apps.</p> <p><img alt="01_blog_overview" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52876" height="561" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/01_blog_overview.png" width="692" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>FileProvider Content URIs</h2> <p>Starting with Android 7 (SDK 24) you cannot use File URIs anymore to share Files to other Android Apps &#8211; you must use a FileProvider to share Files using a Content URI.</p> <p>To avoid this you could use Target SDK 23 as I did for the first parts of this blog.</p> <p>But starting November 1, 2018 Google requires for updates to Apps or new Apps on Google Play to target Android 8 (Oreo, API level 26) or higher, so there&#8217;s no way to share Files on Android without using a FileProvider.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the workflow to update your sharing App from File URI to FileProvider with Content URI.</p> <h3>&#160;Android Manifest</h3> <p>As a&#160;first step we have to add some info to <strong><a href="https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/AndroidManifest.xml">AndroidManifest</a></strong><strong>.xml </strong>:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">&lt;application ...&gt; &lt;provider android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider" android:authorities="org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider" android:grantUriPermissions="true" android:exported="false"&gt; &lt;meta-data android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS" android:resource="@xml/filepaths"/&gt; &lt;/provider&gt; &lt;/application&gt; </pre> <p>The Provider needs the com.android.support.v4 Libraries. To include them, please add com.android.support to your <a href="https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/build.gradle">build.gradle</a>&#160;file:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">dependencies{ ... compile'com.android.support:support-v4:25.3.1' } </pre> <p>This will only work if you have installed the Android Support Repository.</p> <p>In your <em>QtCreator Preferences &#8594; Devices &#8594; Android,&#160;</em>you get easy access to Android SDK Manager. Please check that under Extras the Android Support Repository is installed:</p> <p><em><img alt="02__sdk_manager_support_lib" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52877" height="82" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/02__sdk_manager_support_lib.png" width="1118" /></em></p> <p>In your Android Manifest you see a reference to resources @xml/filepaths. You have to add a new File filepaths.xml under android/res/xml:</p> <p><img alt="03_filepaths_xml" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52878" height="584" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/03_filepaths_xml.png" width="522" /></p> <p>The content of <a href="https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/res/xml/filepaths.xml">filepaths.xml</a>:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">&lt;paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"&gt; &lt;files-path name="my_shared_files" path="share_example_x_files/" /&gt; &lt;/paths&gt; </pre> <p>This is the mapping to the folder where Android will find your File to be shared. This Folder is inside your AppData Location. Remember: in blog part 1 we used a shared documents location to provide Files to other apps. Now for Android we don&#8217;t use a shared location but a path inside our AppData location. Starting the app I always check if the folder exists:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">#if defined (Q_OS_IOS) QString docLocationRoot = QStandardPaths::standardLocations(QStandardPaths::DocumentsLocation).value(0); #endif #if defined(Q_OS_ANDROID) QString docLocationRoot = QStandardPaths::standardLocations(QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation).value(0); #endif mDocumentsWorkPath = docLocationRoot.append("/share_example_x_files"); if (!QDir(mDocumentsWorkPath).exists()) { // create the QDir }</pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last important part in Android Manifest specifies an <strong>Authority</strong>:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">android:authorities="org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider"</pre> <p>This name must be unique &#8211; so it&#8217;s a good idea to use your package name and append .fileprovider.</p> <h2>&#160;QShareUtils Java Code</h2> <p>As&#160;a last step you must do some small changes in <a href="https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample/blob/master/android/src/org/ekkescorner/utils/QShareUtils.java">QShareUtils.java</a>.</p> <p>Import FileProvider and ShareCompat from android.support:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">import android.support.v4.content.FileProvider; import android.support.v4.app.ShareCompat; </pre> <p>Reference the Authority as defined in AndroidManifest:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">private static String AUTHORITY="org.ekkescorner.examples.sharex.fileprovider";</pre> <p>You must also create your Intents in a different way:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">// the old way: Intent sendIntent = new Intent(); Intent sendIntent = ShareCompat.IntentBuilder.from(QtNative.activity()).getIntent(); </pre> <p>You&#8217;re done <img alt="&#55357;&#56898;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p> <p>As a positive side effect, it&#8217;s now much safer to share Files because they are inside your App Sandbox located and not in public shared Folder.</p> <h2>Overview</h2> <p>Here&#8216;s a short Overview about the Android FileProvider implementation:</p> <p><img alt="04_fileprovider_overview" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52879" height="458" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/04_fileprovider_overview.png" width="816" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Some issues from Sharing Files to other Android Apps</h2> <p><strong>Android: Sharing to Google Fotos App</strong></p> <p>If you try to edit an Image in Google Fotos App using the FileProvider, the Fotos App appears in the list of available Apps, but then reports that the File cannot be edited. Viewing works as before.</p> <p>Only current workaround is to use another Foto Editing App.</p> <h2>Thanks</h2> <p>Thanks again to Thomas K. Fischer @taskfabric for his valuable input on this topic.</p> <h2>Have Fun</h2> <p>In the first part of this blog series, I told you that I needed sharing between Apps on Android and iOS for a DropBox &#8211; like customer App. This App is running very well since some months as inHouse App at customer site, so it&#8217;s not publicly available. But my example App is Open Source and now it&#8216;s a good time to download current Version from <a href="https://github.com/ekke/ekkesSHAREexample">Github</a>, build and run the <strong>Sharing Example App</strong>.</p> <p>This was the last part of this blog series, but stay tuned for some other blogs about &#8222;Qt mobile Apps in the Enterprise&#8220; and &#8222;QML Camera on Android and iOS&#8220;.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/06/sharing-files-android-ios-qt-app-part-4/" rel="nofollow">Sharing Files on Android or iOS from or with your Qt App &#8211; Part 4</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blog.qt.io" rel="nofollow">Qt Blog</a>.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-06T15:55:05.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">KDAB on Qt</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-18961 fllt" height="250" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-12.30.44-copy-159x300.jpg" style="margin: 0 15px 0 0;" width="" />This year&#8217;s North American stop on the Qt World Summit world tour was in Boston, held during the Red Sox&#8217;s World Series win. Most of us were glad to be flying home before celebration parades closed the streets! The Qt community has reason to celebrate too, as there&#8217;s an unprecedented level of adoption and support for our favorite UX framework. If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend, you missed the best Qt conference on this continent. We had a whole host of KDABians onsite, running training sessions and delivering great talks alongside all the other excellent content. For those of you who missed it, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; there&#8217;s another opportunity coming up! The next stop on Qt&#8217;s European tour will be with Qt World Summit Berlin December 5-6. Be sure to <a href="https://www.qt.io/qtws18/training-day-at-qt-world-summit-berlin-2018">sign up for one of the training sessions</a> now before they&#8217;re sold out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, let me give you a taste of what the Boston Qt World Summit had to offer.</p> <h3>Strong Community</h3> <p><img alt="" class=" wp-image-18960 alignright flrt" height="183" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-12.32.31-1-225x300.jpg" width="137" />One thing was clear: after 23 years, Qt is still going strong. The Qt Company and the greater Qt community have contributed 29,000 commits and fixed 5000 bugs between Qt 5.6.3 and the current head branch. Very kindly and much appreciated, Lars Knoll, CTO of the Qt Company, recognized KDAB as the largest and longest <a href="https://www.kdab.com/kdab-contributions-qt-5-9/">external contributor</a> to the ever-growing Qt codebase in his opening keynote. All of this effort &#8211; and most of the things discussed in this blog &#8211; come to fruition in Qt 5.12 LTS, with an expected release date at the end of November.</p> <h3>Qt is Everywhere</h3> <div class="wp-caption alignleft fllt" id="attachment_18956" style="width: 186px;"><img alt="Training day @ QtWS18" class=" wp-image-18956" height="132" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-11.21.33-300x225.jpg" style="margin: 0 20px 0 0;" width="176" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Training day @ QtWS18</p></div> <p>Another observation is that Qt is everywhere. Lars shared that it has now been downloaded five million times, a huge increase from three and a half million just two years ago. The more than 400 attendees at Qt World Summit Boston came from over 30 industries, representing academia, automotive, bioscience, defense, design, geo imaging, industrial automation, energy and utilities, and plenty more. All the training sessions and the talks were well attended, most to full capacity with eager attendees standing at the back.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3>Cross-platform Qt</h3> <p>Is there a reason for this upsurge in Qt interest? Multi-platform is now a critical strategy for nearly every product today. Since Qt provides comprehensive support for mobiles, desktops, and embedded, it has become a top choice for broad cross-platform UX development. It&#8217;s not enough to release a cool, innovative product &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t link to your desktop or provide a mobile-compatible connection, it often can&#8217;t get off the ground.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignright fllt" id="attachment_18962" style="width: 189px;"><img alt="Qt for Microcontrollers" class=" wp-image-18962" height="134" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-15.45.00-300x225.jpg" style="margin: 0 20px 0 0;" width="179" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Qt for Microcontrollers</p></div> <p>While there weren&#8217;t too many new platforms announced that Qt doesn&#8217;t already run on, there was invigorated discussion and demoing at the low end of the embedded spectrum. <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/03/qt-microncontrollers-mcu/">Qt on Microcontrollers</a> is a new initiative, trimming Qt down to run on smaller MMU-less chips like the Arm Cortext-M7. While still needing some optimization and trimming to get to the smallest configurations, Qt on Microcontrollers currently takes 3-10MB of RAM and 6-13MB of ROM/Flash, making it an attractive option to create one code base that can address a range of products regardless of form factor.</p> <h3>Broad Offering</h3> <p>Another reason behind Qt&#8217;s increasing prominence is the breadth of the Qt offering. From 3D through design to web, there are many new improvements and components that make Qt a safe choice for teams that need to continually expand their product&#8217;s capabilities. While there have been a host of new additions to the Qt portfolio, here are a few of the more notable ones.</p> <h4 style="text-align: left;">Qt 3D Studio</h4> <p>In a programmer&#8217;s worldview, design is often a nice-to-have, yet not a must-have. I guarantee that perspective will change for anyone who had the good fortune of attending Beyond the UX Tipping Point, the keynote from Jared Spool, the so-called Maker of Awesome from Center Centre.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignleft fllt" id="attachment_18875" style="width: 301px;"><a href="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Kuesa-designers-1.png"><img alt="Kuesa preview" class=" wp-image-18875" height="159" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Kuesa-designers-1-300x164.png" style="margin: 0 20px 0 0;" width="291" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuesa preview</p></div> <p>If you weren&#8217;t able to attend the conference, I recommend you watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/164258612/">Jared&#8217;s video</a>. Once you do, you&#8217;ll be glad that the Qt Company just released Qt Design Studio to help build great interfaces. KDABian Mike Krus also gave a tantalizing preview of Kuesa, a new KDAB tool architected to marry the worlds of design and development. We&#8217;ve got some info on <a href="https://www.kdab.com/kuesa">our Kuesa webpage</a>&#160;(and a screenshot here) &#8211; keep an eye out for more to come soon.</p> <h4 style="clear: both;">Qt for Python</h4> <p>As an aficionado of the language, I&#8217;ve always found Python seriously missing UX support &#8211; there are solutions but none that are ideal. With the release of Qt for Python however, Python finally has a capable, regularly maintained UI tool with a huge community. This includes integration into the Qt Creator IDE; it will now go from a technical preview to officially supported in <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python">Qt 5.12 and beyond</a>. I predict that this will soon make Qt the UI framework of choice for Python &#8211; happy news for the many folks who prefer C++ be neatly tucked under the covers.</p> <h4>WebAssembly</h4> <p>There are some clear benefits to running code within a browser recognized by cloud companies &#8211; lightweight (and often no) installation required, access everywhere to centralized, managed, and backed-up data stores, along with immediate and hassle-free updates. Those same benefits have now come to Qt with the support of WebAssembly. This lets you compile your Qt application (and with C++ too, not just QML/Qt Quick, mind you) into a WebAssembly compatible package to be deployed on a web server. This technology is now in tech preview, but it&#8217;s an active project that will be able to expand the reach of Qt into the cloud realm.</p> <h3>Building Bridges</h3> <p><img alt="Frances and Ann #color4cancer" class="size-medium wp-image-18955 fllt" height="" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/2018-10-29-10.11.56-300x225.jpg" style="margin: 0 20px 0 0;" width="250" />Maybe all this flurry of Qt activity is also because it provides a common platform that can build a bridge between disparate disciplines like art, technology, and research. An example of this is&#160;<a href="http://bit.ly/2AKqIbo">nanoQuill</a>, a collaboration between KDAB, the Qt Company, a biotech company:&#160;<a href="http://bit.ly/2Ofp7fS">Quantitative Imaging Systems (Qi)</a>, and Oregon Health &amp; Science University that crowd-sources electron microscope images of cancer cells for people to artfully color, thus&#160;<a href="http://bit.ly/2AKpsFc">#color4cancer</a>.</p> <p>Based on Qi&#8217;s vision of merging programming and computer&#160;graphics with microscopy, nanoQuill built&#160;an application to&#160;use&#160;machine learning on these human colored images to discern cell micro structures, which in turn helps us understand how tumour cells develop resistance to escape cancer-targeting drugs.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignright fllt" id="attachment_18963" style="width: 260px;"><img alt="Final #color4cancer cell" class="size-medium wp-image-18963 flrt" height="" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/IMG_4974-300x225.jpg" style="margin: 0 20px 0 0;" width="250" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Final #color4cancer cell</p></div> <p>Currently, nanoQuill allows anyone to #color4cancer and post their artwork via their&#160;<a href="http://bit.ly/2ln2ucB">website gallery</a>,&#160;a coloring book,&#160;<a href="http://amzn.to/2Ciujuw">nanoQuill: The Coloring Book of Life</a>&#160;published in December of 2017, and will soon be in a form of an app. We had a large nanoQuill poster in our booth that people colored throughout the event, allowing Qt World Summit attendees to truthfully say they were not only learning about the latest Qt developments, they were helping fight cancer with art.</p> <h3 style="clear: both;">CNC Craftspeople</h3> <div class="wp-caption alignleft fllt" id="attachment_18965" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Shaper Origin in action" class="size-medium wp-image-18965 flrt" height="175" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-9.31.03-AM-300x175.png" width="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shaper Origin in action</p></div> <p>Another great merger of art and technology was seen at our KDAB customer showcase from a company called <a href="https://www.shapertools.com/">Shaper Tools</a>. If you think you saw a table full of dominos at the edge of our booth, we weren&#8217;t passing the time playing &#8211; those &#8220;dominos&#8221; were actually optical registration tapes that allowed Shaper&#8217;s hand-held CNC machine to perfectly cut complex shapes. Look at some of the amazing projects that <a href="https://youtu.be/iEv2wcOukjQ">woodworkers have created using the Shaper Origin</a>, and you&#8217;ll see that advanced technology doesn&#8217;t have to replace master craftsmanship &#8211; it can enable it.</p> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>Whether you attended Qt World Summit 2018 to learn about the details of C++ and Qt or the industry trends in medical, automotive, and IoT, there was lots in Boston for everyone. If you care to share in the comments, we&#8217;d love to hear what your favourite session was and the best thing you learned.</p> <p>The post <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-world-summit-2018-boston/" rel="nofollow">Qt World Summit 2018 Boston</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.kdab.com" rel="nofollow">KDAB</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I always think the way I became involved in Fedora was unique. Most people will start contributing virtually, in IRC, mailing lists, pull requests, or other ways. For me, my journey into the Fedora community began at Flock 2015 in Rochester, NY. Conveniently, the conference was the week before the day I would move to Rochester to begin my first year of academic studies at a university in Rochester. I decided to move up early and attend because I was a Fedora user and thought it would be interesting to be a part of Flock.</p><p>Flock was amazing and I saw how diverse and large the Fedora community was. People from around the world were here to discuss, plan, and move forward this open source project. One of the things that stood out to me was the conference was more than just hard work and professional context (it was these things too) – but at the end of the day, I could see these people were friends with each other too, and I got to know the Fedora community in a more personal way. One example of this I remember was the Fedora Marketing planning session. There were many intense discussions with many disagreements, but delivered constructively. Then, later that evening, I saw a lot of the same people who were debating intensely either eating together or sharing some drinks, talking like friends that had known each other for years.</p><p>At this time, I was not a contributor. I didn&#8217;t know anyone in the conference. I went alone. I moved into Rochester that week coming from Atlanta, Georgia, so it was a new conference and a new city that was my new home, but it didn&#8217;t feel this way to me yet. There was one point when there was a coffee break and no talks were going on. Many people were talking, but I was quietly off to the side by myself. I didn&#8217;t know who he was at the time, but Pete Travis approached me and started a friendly conversation, about who I was, why I decided to come to Flock, and some of my interests.</p><p>We talked about a few things, but I remember nerding out about a crazy idea of how Fedora could better target a younger audience through gaming. At the time, I was a staff member of one of the largest open source Minecraft server software projects. I saw how so many kids and young adults were exposed to open source and became involved with open source because of Minecraft. I forget what the tie-in to Fedora was, but there was a crazy idea of how Fedora could try to grow and attract those kinds of people as users to the distribution.</p><p>I think the idea was a little pie-in-the-sky, but Pete didn&#8217;t criticize it or shoot it down. He talked with me about it and made me feel like I could be onto something if I developed the idea further. But the important part wasn&#8217;t anything about my crazy idea. In that moment, I started to feel less of an outsider. I started to think of things I could bring to this open source community and project. For the first time, I didn&#8217;t think of myself as an observer, but I realized I could be a participant too, if I made the effort to get involved and participate. I doubt Pete even remembers this, but for me, it was somewhere in that moment where I began to feel a part of this huge community I had spent most of the week just watching.</p><p>Even though I haven&#8217;t seen Pete for a while now, his impact on me starting my journey into Fedora was huge. For the last three years, my adventure and time in Fedora has taken me to all kinds of new places and I have had countless new experiences. And yet, somehow in the last three years of everything that I have seen and has happened to me, I can remember this one simple experience that made a big difference to me.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://blog.justinwflory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin W.

        <p>Chrys took up the role of coordinator, fixer and new master of KDE accessibility, which I think is just fantastic. We have been working on what he decided to be most important, mostly chrys fixing issues to make things work with Plasma and screen readers. After getting Orca to read desktop icons he spent quite some time to improve the various start menus.</p> <p>With so much fresh energy around I started poking at KWin, which was a bit scary, to be honest. It was fun to read code I hadn&#8217;t looked at before. In the end, after I spent a while working on a huge work-around, it turned out that we could enable the task switcher to work with relatively little code added. The main issue was that KWin does really not want to give focus to the task switcher. My first attempt was to write sub-classes of <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html">QAccessibleInterface</a> for everything in KWin. That started to work, but during some debugging I realized that KWin was actually creating the regular representations for its UI, it was just not properly announcing them to Orca. Thus I threw away my almost complete prototype. At least I verified that it&#8217;s possible to create an entire Qt UI for screen readers only, disconnected from the actual UI. Thanks to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessible.html#installFactory">QAccessible::installFactory</a> it is nowadays pretty easy to instantiate custom representations (subclasses of <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaccessibleinterface.html">QAccessibleInterface</a>). Once that was done, I started over and made the task switcher think it&#8217;s an active window without letting X11 or Wayland know. That way we get the right dbus messages sent to Orca, when alt-tabbing through the windows. Thanks David, Martin, Roman and Vlad for your input <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://blogs.fsfe.org/gladhorn/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> </p> <p>More work is needed on Plasma when it comes to keyboard usability &#8211; getting the focus onto the panel and the various notification areas. I&#8217;m sure some great ideas are already being worked on, but I can see this easily as a blocker going forward. Configuring the network, checking the battery status and other tasks are really important after all.</p> <p>I wrote the basics for Kate to work with screen readers in 2014 and it seems like there are some improvements needed when working with Orca, luckily we got some help from Joanie (who maintains Orca) to figure out what goes wrong when navigating by lines. Now it&#8217;s just to verify the findings and get the issues sorted out.</p> <p>If you have a bit of time and want to help, we need someone with good English skills to help clean up the wiki. Good written instructions are really helpful when getting blind users to try Plasma for the first time. We&#8217;d also be happy if more people joined in testing and improving things. Join the <a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-accessibility">KDE Accessibility mailing list</a> to join the fun.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I had never contributed to any open source project before Fedora. I found open source intimidating &#8211; and I used to think a thousand times before sending any message on IRC. During those first few days, I used webchat to connect to IRC &#8211; simply because I didn&#8217;t know any other alternative. The internet connection I was using was also not that good and I was worried it would drop off and I would miss a message. I am not sure if I missed any messages but after a few days, Justin reached out and helped me set up my IRC bouncer. I am pretty sure I asked him stupid questions but he didn’t show it and I am glad for that! That act of empathy gave me a new found motivation to contribute to Fedora and I have continued since (even though the bouncer hasn&#8217;t!).&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://bee2502.github.io/" target="_blank">Bee Padalkar</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/2" target="_blank">contributor-stories#2</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It was year 2009 and I move from my native city to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caracas</a>.<br>I met tatica several years ago, in my college years, when I was trying to promote FLOSS in my university with my LUG and travel across the country with a national congress. She was also the photographer of my wedding.</p><p>At that time (2009) I was working with the Ubuntu Local Community and we were more focused in attend events and some installations. Once at Caracas I met with tatica to help with the organization of the FLISoL and she was the national coordinator. In that FLISoL I was representing Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu and I saw the Fedora stand, they were showing the stuff I usually do in my Ubuntu, but with Fedora, and that let me to think, I can try Fedora again (I knew Fedora Core 3 and 4 before, but I didn&#8217;t found it interesting). After FLISoL, I was a little upset and tire about the Ubuntu Community because I was wanting to do more, more than just events, more than a personal blog, more than just show the distro, but I focused in my job and I started to get away from the community, but still using Linux at a daily basis.</p><p>Getting in touch with people at Caracas and nearby areas, I&#8217;ve attended to a meeting with one of the oldest hardcore communities in Venezuela, I knew several of the guys there, including tatica, in that meeting she invited me to the FUDCon that will be held in Valencia (2012). There I notice something that I never notice before, and it wasn&#8217;t the event or the talks, It was the community itself that took my attention. There I have the chance of talk to several Ambassadors from Latam and to know how their work was actually affecting the distro, not only giving talks, but working in packaging, testing, coding, design, marketing and a lot of areas that actually helps the distro to grow, hand to hand with the community. That year I talked with tatica and told her I want to be part of this and I receive from her an advice that I still carry with me when I&#8217;m going to do something related to the community: &#8220;We are Friends, we have a Free, First and Feature distro to complete our 4 Foundations but the real gasoline that keep this engine going is the commitment. If you want to work with this awesome community be honest, be committed and be humble, that way you will gain trust in the community and things will be great both for you and for Fedora&#8221;. After that year I was going in and out of the community until 2016 when I email her and told I want to be an Ambassador. She IS my mentor, she taught me how this wheel rolls and she still give me advices in times of despair. For that and more, my contributor story is about her. Thanks so much.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/x3m" target="_blank">Eduard Lucena</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/4" target="_blank">contributor-stories#4</a></cite></blockquote>

<h2>Baby steps towards Open Source!</h2>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I still remember that day when I mailed her. I wanted to start on something (FOSS related) but I had no proper direction on what I should do. She was a total stranger but I stalked her on several places (hope she doesn&#8217;t mind <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f47d.png" alt="👽" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) and it was really inspiring to see all the work she was doing and to be honest I just found Women Open Source contributors really cool because I am so intimidated by it. But I never expected her to reply me back or provide me with so much help.</p><p>And well, she mailed me back quite promptly, giving me more direction on how to start, she introduced me to this great community and gave me leads on what are the kinds of work I could do. The reply did overwhelm me. I feel starting is the hardest part and having such a strong and warm community around you helps you grow magnificently. I can&#8217;t thank her enough on helping me to get started on this. Now I know a wonderful community and a friendly group of hard working people like <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jflory7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jonatoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jona</a>, and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Amsharma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amita</a> who are a constant source of motivation.</p><p>Though I am still just taking the baby steps towards this, I hope to be better with time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Cheers to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bee2502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bee</a> and everyone at Fedora!&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://github.com/reCursedd" target="_blank">Dyuti</a> &#8211; <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-commops/contributor-stories/issue/7" target="_blank">contributor-stories#7</a></cite></blockquote>

        <p>Today we released version 1.10 of the KDE Connect Android app. Therefore it&#8217;s time again to share what we&#8217;ve been working on.</p> <h2>Targeting Android Oreo</h2> <p>As of this month&#160;app updates uploaded to Google Play need to <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk">target Android 8</a>. This has several implications.&#160;Targeting Oreo comes with an updated Support Library, which forces us to drop support for Android 4.0 and below. According to our Google Play data this will affect approximately 400 users. We are very sorry about that, but these users won&#8217;t receive further updates. Furthermore, Android Oreo introduced some restrictions in regard to apps running in the background. In the future in order to be able to run in the background KDE Connect needs to show a persistent notification. The good news is that you can hide the notification. The (slightly) bad news is that we cannot do it by default. To hide the notification you need to long-press it and switch it off. Other notifications from KDE Connect are unaffected by this.</p> <h2>1.10 Changes</h2> <p>These are the main changes of version 1.10. Not mentioned are countless small improvements and under-the-hood changes.</p> <p>Mouse input now works with the same speed independent from the phones pixel density.</p> <p>The media controller now allows stopping playback.</p> <p>Run command supports triggering commands using kdeconnect:// URLs. Useful for integration with NFC tags and 3rd-party apps.</p> <p>The notification filter allows quickly (de-)selecting all apps.</p> <p>Several settings scatterd across the UI have been bundled into a single settings screen.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into how we handle SMS on the Android side in preparation for something huge. Stay tuned <img alt="&#55357;&#56841;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p> <h2>Other changes</h2> <p>The desktop side has improved as well since my last post.</p> <p>The windows build of KDE Connect gained support for keyboard input.</p> <p>The plasmoid gained a couple of additions. In my last update I mentioned that it is possible to run commands from there. It is now also possible to lauch the command setup from there. Furthermore it is now possible to select files to share them from there.</p> <p>The Linux Mobile App gained many visual improvements and features. It now supports sharing files and controlling the system volume.</p> <p>If you are using&#160;<a href="https://volkerkrause.eu/2018/08/19/kde-itinerary-introduction.html">Itinerary</a>&#160;you can send booking information from the PC directly to the phone via KDE Connect.</p> <p>It is now possible to send files directly from Pantheon Files (and other Elementary apps) and Thunar via KDE Connect.</p> <p>Again, there are countless other improvements that I did not explicitly mention.</p> <p>A big thanks to all people who contributed to this!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The KMyMoney development team is proud to present <a href="http://download.kde.org/stable/kmymoney/5.0.2/src/kmymoney-5.0.2.tar.xz.mirrorlist">version 5.0.2</a> of its open source Personal Finance Manager.</p> <p>Although several members of the development team had been using version 5.0.1 in production for some time, a number of bugs and regressions slipped through testing, mainly in areas and features not used by them.</p> <p>These have been reported by many of you and the development team worked hard to fix them in the meantime. The result of this effort is the new KMyMoney 5.0.2 release.</p> <p>Despite even more extensive testing than usual, we understand that some bugs may have slipped past our best efforts. If you find one of them, please forgive us, and be sure to report it, either to the <a href="mailto:kmymoney-devel@kde.org">mailing list</a> or on <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=kmymoney&amp;format=guided">bugs.kde.org</a>.</p> <p>From here, we will continue to fix reported bugs, and working to add many requested additions and enhancements, as well as further improving performance.</p> <h2>Thanks</h2> <p>Many thanks go out to KDE&#8217;s sysadmin team. Ben in particular supported us with numerous hours to get daily builds onto the <a href="https://build.kde.org">KDE CI system</a>. This even includes MS-Windows installers. Please feel free to visit our overview page of the CI builds at <a href="https://kmymoney.org/build.php">https://kmymoney.org/build.php</a>.</p> <p>Thanks also to those users who provided valuable support by sending in test files saved by earlier versions as far back as <a href="https://kmymoney.org/news.php#itemKMyMoney466released">KMyMoney 4.6.6</a>. Using these files we were able to fix some upgrade problems.</p> <h2>The details</h2> <p>Here is the list of the bugs which have been fixed:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=283784">283784</a> when using the &#8216;amount entry widget&#8217;

      <div class="content">
        <p>We continue adding support for more data formats that can be imported into LabPlot. As part of the upcoming release we add the <strong>support for JSON file and for ngspice raw file format</strong> which we want to introduce in this short blog post.</p> <p>After the selection of a <strong>JSON</strong> file in the &#8220;Import File&#8221; dialog, its content is shown in a tree view in a manner that many user will be familiar with from other JSON viewers. The relevant parts in a such a JSON file that one usually wants to visualize are arrays and objects. Once the root element that needs to be imported is selected, LabPlot automatically recognizes its type and the type of its children and generates a two dimensional preview of the data to be imported. This works the same for arrays</p> <p><center><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="JSON array" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array.png" width="40%" /></a> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png" title=""><img alt="Preview of JSON array" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_array_preview.png" width="40%" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>as well as for JSON objects<br /> <center><a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="JSON object" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object.png" width="40%" /></a> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png" title=""><img alt="Preview of JSON object" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/json_object_preview.png" width="40%" /></a><br /> </center></p> <p>After such a local file was imported, the plotting of data can be done as usual. The part that is of more practical interest, namely the import of data from online web services like stock prices, weather data, data monitoring services, etc., still needs to be implemented. Such services usually exchange the data in JSON format and the features described above can be considered as the preparational steps also in this direction. This is something for the near future.</p> <p><br /> In the previous release we made the support for live data available. To demonstrate this feature we used an <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/2018/05/16/support-for-live-data/" title="">example</a> based on the results of calculations done in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap.html" title="">Gnucap</a> &#8211; an open-source circuit simulator. The Gnucap simulation was controlled by a small PyQt GUI and the results where written out to an ASCII file which was then consumed by LabPlot (import of live data and its visualization). To further support this community, we decided to add the support for <strong>native raw format of ngspice</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/" title="">another open-source application for circuit analysis</a>. We read both flavors of it &#8211; binary and ASCII. When opening such a file, LabPlot auto-detects the ngspice raw format and selects the proper import filter.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, we use a simple circuit consisting of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFET" title="">junction gate field-effect transistor</a> and of two variable voltages &#8211; gate-source and drain-source:<center><br /> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="Circuit" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit.png" width="50%" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>The behavior of such a transistor is usually studied with the help of its &#8220;characteristic curves&#8221; &#8211; the transfer characteristic showing the current as the function of the gain-source voltage and the output characteristic showing the current as the function of the drain-source voltage. This time the calculation is done with ngspice and we read the produced raw files with the new import filter: <center><br /> <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png" title=""><br /> <img alt="Transistor Characteristic Curves" src="https://labplot.kde.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/transistor_characteristic_curves.png" width="100%" /><br /> </a><br /> </center></p> <p>To generate the second plot where a family of I<sub>d</sub> curves is calculated for different values of V<sub>gs</sub>, we had to implement a new feature in LabPlot to allow to only connect points that are monotonically increasing. Since all the curves in this family are put into the same data set, without this options the end points of the lines would have been connected with the origin which is not what the user wants to see for this specific data set.</p> <p>The idea for this example and the technical input around ngspice was contributed by Orestes Mas from the Technical University of Catalonia.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-02T10:00:24.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Freso</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the things various people have asked MusicBrainz for time and time again has been genres. However, genres are <em>hard</em> to do right and they&#8217;re very much subjective—with MusicBrainz dealing almost exclusively with objective data. It&#8217;s been a recurring discussion on almost all of <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit">our summits</a>, but a couple years ago (with some help from our friend Alastair Porter and his research colleagues at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">UPF</a>), we finally came to a path forward—and recently Nicolás Tamargo (reosarevok) finally turned that path forward into code… which has now been released! You can see it in action on e.g., <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e">Nine Inch Nails’ Year Zero release group</a>.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For now genres are <em>exactly the same as <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Folksonomy_Tagging">(folksonomy) tags</a></em> behind the scenes; some tags simply have become the chosen ones and are listed and presented as genres. The list of which tags are considered as genres is currently <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/entities.json#L666">hardcoded</a>, and no doubt it is missing a lot of our users&#8217; favourite genres. We plan to expand the genre list based on your requests, so if you find a genre that is missing from it, request it by <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10032&amp;issuetype=2&amp;summary=Enter%20the%20genre%20name%20here!">adding a style ticket</a> with the &#8220;Genres&#8221; component.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, genres are very subjective, so just like with folksonomy tags, you can upvote and downvote genres you agree or disagree with on any given entity, and you can also submit genre(s) for the entity that no one has added yet.</p>
<h3>What about the API?</h3>
<p>A bunch of the people asking for genres in MusicBrainz have been <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Enabled_Applications">application developers</a>, and this type of people are usually more interested in how to actually extract the genres from our data.</p>
<p>The method to request genres mirrors that of tags: you can use <code>inc=genres</code> to get all the genres everyone has proposed for the entity, or <code>inc=user-genres</code> to get all the genres you have proposed yourself (or both!). For the same release group as before, you&#8217;d want <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres</code></a> for the XML API and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json</code></a> for the JSON API.</p>
<p>Since genres are tags, all the genres will continue to be served with <code>inc=tags</code> as before as well. As such, you can always use the tag endpoint if you would rather filter the tags by your own genre list rather than follow the MusicBrainz one, or if you want to also get other non-genre tags (maybe you want moods, or maybe you&#8217;re really interested in finding artists who perform hip hop music <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/tag/death%20by%20murder">were murdered</a> – we won&#8217;t stop you!).</p>
<h4>I use the database directly, not the API</h4>
<p>You can parse the <code>tag</code>→<code>genres</code> from <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/raw/master/entities.json"><code>entities.json</code> in the root of the &#8220;musicbrainz-server&#8221; repository</a> which will give you a list of what we currently consider genres. Then you can simply compare any folksonomy tags from the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema#tag_table.2C_.26_the_.2A_tag_and_tag_raw_tables"><code>%_tag</code> tables</a>.</p>
<h4>Note about licensing</h4>
<p>One thing to keep in mind for any data consumers out there is that, as per our <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/Data_License">data licensing</a>, tags—and thus also genres—are not part of our &#8220;core (CC0-licensed) data&#8221;, but rather part of our &#8220;supplementary data&#8221; which is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-<strong>NonCommercial</strong> license</a>. Thus, if you wish to use our genre data for something commercial, you should get a commercial use license from the <a href="https://metabrainz.org/">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>. (Of course, if you&#8217;re going to provide a commercial product using data from MusicBrainz, you should always sign up as a <a href="https://metabrainz.org/supporters">supporter</a> regardless. :)).</p>
<h3>The future?</h3>
<p>We are hoping to get a better coverage of genres (especially genres outside of the Western tradition, of which we have a very small amount right now) with your help! That applies both to expanding the genre list and actually applying genres to entities. For the latter, remember that everyone can downvote your genre suggestion if they don&#8217;t agree, so don&#8217;t think too much about &#8220;what genres does the world think apply to this artist/release/whatever&#8221;. Just add what <strong>you</strong> feel is right; if everyone does that we&#8217;ll get much better information. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In the near future we&#8217;re hoping to move the genre list from the code to the database (which shouldn&#8217;t mean too much for most of you, other than less waiting between a new genre being proposed for the list and it being added, but is much better for future development). Also planned is a way to indicate that several tags are the same genre (so that if you tag something as &#8220;hiphop&#8221;, &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; the system will understand that&#8217;s really all the same). Further down the line, who knows! We might eventually make genres into limited entities of a sort, in order to allow linking to, say, the appropriate Wikidata/Wikipedia pages. We might do some fun stuff. Time will tell!</p>

        <p>Hullo!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working on a system to import listens automatically to ListenBrainz from Spotify and we&#8217;ve recently deployed it to <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org">the ListenBrainz beta site</a>. We would really appreciate it if you could help us test it out!</p>
<p>Please note that this is still beta software, there is a (very small) chance that we might miss a listen or two. So if you&#8217;re using this, please make sure that ListenBrainz is not the only service where you&#8217;re archiving your listens.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that importing the same listens from two different sources such as Last.FM and Spotify may cause the creation of duplicates in your listen history. If you opt into our automatic Spotify import, please do not use the Last.FM import or submit listens from other ListenBrainz clients. This is a temporary limitation while we find better ways to deduplicate listens.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for the caveats, please go ahead and use the new shiny <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org/profile/connect-spotify">Spotify Importer</a>. And feel free to report bugs on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org">tickets.metabrainz.org</a> or <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">on IRC</a> in #metabrainz on Freenode.</p>

        <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is honored to join the <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/about-gni/">Global Network Initiative</a> (GNI) as an observer, an opportunity we hope will advance our efforts to champion freedom of expression and privacy for the Wikimedia community and beyond. GNI is a channel for collective action, advocating to governments and international institutions for policies and laws which promote free expression and privacy. As an observer to GNI, the Wikimedia Foundation will be able to benefit from this accomplished network of human rights defenders, and apply the insights we gain to our existing worldwide efforts to advance these two fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Principle to the Wikimedia movement is the idea of collaboration. Our projects are continually expanded and improved by a global community of volunteers, and we rely on donations from millions of people worldwide to continue operating year after year. Thus, when the opportunity arose to join GNI and collaborate with other leaders in both technology and digital rights, it was only natural for the Wikimedia Foundation to engage. Everyone who joins GNI, from large technology companies to civil society groups fighting for human rights online, has indicated their commitment to addressing and solving the most prescient issues in <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/">GNI’s focus areas</a>. By working with other member organizations and companies to further the rights of internet users worldwide, our participation as an observer in GNI will be just one of many ways we give back to the global community who supports the Wikimedia movement.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation understands that the protection and <a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/">promotion of human rights online</a> is essential to what we do. In order to provide access to knowledge for everyone, we must protect freedom of expression on our projects. In practice, this means we work to keep Wikipedia volunteers free from attempts to <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/22/a-letter-to-minister-ahmet-arslan/">block</a> or censor their writing on Wikipedia or requests to <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/20/wikimedia-releases-ninth-transparency-report/">remove their content</a>. We hope that by participating in GNI, we can share our experiences not only as a large internet platform, but as a mission-driven organization that holds our values firm even in the face of threats. In return, we are sure that the insights we will gain from the combined experience of GNI’s members will help us to better our initiatives to promote free expression for our communities.</p>
<p>In addition to freedom of expression, GNI and its members believe in respecting user privacy rights, including initiatives to increase <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/surveillance/">transparency and accountability in government surveillance</a>. We believe that strong privacy rules and opposition to surveillance are a fundamental part of the freedom that allows people to read and contribute to Wikipedia.  The Wikimedia Foundation has taken a clear stance defending our users’ right to privacy by taking part in a<a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/"> lawsuit challenging the NSA’s upstream surveillance collection</a> activities and encrypting all traffic to and from Wikimedia projects through the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/">HTTPS protocol</a>. By taking concrete steps to defend user privacy, we are able to offer a unique perspective to other GNI members interested in how to better protect individuals. We hope that the connections we make within GNI will strengthen our own efforts to ensure that people are free to read and write Wikipedia without fear of anyone looking over their shoulder.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation reflects our commitment to GNI’s mission in both our actions as the host of Wikipedia and our greater advocacy efforts through the Wikimedia movement. We are excited to collaborate with and learn from the variety of committed organizations and individuals who make up GNI in order to further these efforts to promote freedom of expression and privacy worldwide and ensure that everyone, everywhere can have access to knowledge.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-29T16:00:53.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Ben Vershbow and Sandra Fauconnier</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation asked designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Oates">George Oates</a>, who has worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">Flickr</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library">Open Library</a>, among others, to conduct a deep dive into <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the free media repository that provides many of the images used on Wikipedia. We wanted a fresh pair of eyeballs, and we were particularly interested in Oates’ observations about possible areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Oates soon realized navigating Wikimedia Commons and finding interesting materials is challenging. She noted how the category system used to organize and tag media files on Commons is confusing and hides—not shows—the richness of content there. Other areas of improvement she mentioned include making both contributors and contributions more prominent and inviting, improving the user experience for new users, and actively recruiting more diverse gender participation in the project. (Oates noted that the group of administrators on Wikimedia Commons is internationally diverse, but not so much in terms of gender; this affects, for instance, the selection of featured images.)</p>
<p>Oates also identified several ways in which Wikimedia Commons can work more fruitfully with GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). This is partially due to her background in the field: over the last decade, she as worked on a series of projects that have reimagined how the world engages with the collections of libraries, archives, and museums on the web.</p>
<p>She created <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">the Commons on Flickr,</a> which to this day stands as one of the most popular shared platforms for the world’s visual archives. She worked with the Internet Archive to lead the Open Library, a universal and openly editable catalog of the world’s books, connected to a digital lending library. More recently, she has worked with a variety of individual institutions to devise new ways of exploring their collections, like this experimental <a href="http://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org/">interface</a> to the Wellcome Library collection in the UK.</p>
<p>As we contemplate the future of cultural partnerships and the sharing of open collections in the Wikimedia movement, the Foundation asked George to do a short assignment: look at Wikimedia Commons through the lens of your background and experience, tell us candidly what you see, and suggest areas for improvement. We asked her to focus on the experience of new users, of cultural institutions, and to share with us some ideas of how Commons might evolve in the years ahead. Ben Vershbow (Director of Community Programs) and Sandra Fauconnier (Program Officer for GLAM and Structured Data) sat down with George to speak with her about her findings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Please tell us about yourself!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> I’ve <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeoates">worked</a> on the web since 1996, mostly in design-centered roles. I designed a lot of the user interface of the photosharing service, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, for the first few years, wrote its <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> (with Heather Champ), and particularly enjoyed creating the privacy and safety tools that helped people coexist. Since 2008, I’ve specialised in the cultural heritage sector, and today, I’m based in London, building an edtech company called <a href="http://www.museuminabox.org/">Museum in a Box</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: What were your first impressions of Wikimedia Commons, looking at it as a &#8216;well-informed newbie&#8217; and with your background of having worked on Flickr, and Flickr Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p>Turns out, Commons is huge, dense, variegated, and alive.</p>
<p>It’s a system that’s about the size of Hong Kong (7.3 million people), but it’s only about 14 years old. Hong Kong has been settled for centuries. Just like the city, Commons is full of nooks and crannies, mazes, rules, signs, and people doing their thing.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4671557223/">map of Hong Kong</a> drawn using locations where photos were taken. “Blue pictures are by locals. Red pictures are by tourists. Yellow pictures might be by either.”</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59316"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59316 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4671557223_c7c11f6d3d_b.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For me, this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157624209158632">Locals and Tourists</a> project symbolises the way people move around software systems. Software can be learned like a place. You can move around it how you see fit, and inhabit corners you like. You can see other people in it, and follow, copy, like, ignore, and meet them.</p>
<p>This sort of socialising and movement happens on Commons too, but there’s an important difference between Commons, and, say, Facebook, and that’s that <em>the locals are building the city</em>. The ‘old school’ admins know the back alleys and the best noodles, and the Commons newbies head for the tourist hotspots.</p>
<p>So, in terms of my first impressions, I faced three primary challenges to get to a position where I could present ideas, not just observe:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a newbie to the platform, unfamiliar with its rules, rituals and traditions</li>
<li>There’s a major usability challenge: Information vs Interface</li>
<li>The rules of engagement are not clear</li>
</ol>
<p>But, it also feels important to say that <strong><em>maybe there’s nothing wrong with it</em></strong>. The question in itself reveals a quiet tension. The Wikimedia Foundation’s team who support the Commons is in a hard, interesting position. They’re a crew of professional, philosophically aligned staff who find it difficult to help improve Commons. They meet resistance from the old guard, the community of volunteer admins and other long-term Commons folk who are there every day, have probably been there longer than anyone who works at the Foundation, feel deep ownership of the system, and can exercise deep control. They’ve patiently and visibly negotiated the dynamics of the system for the last fourteen years.</p>
<p>So, the question becomes <em>what is it OK for the Wikimedia Foundation to do</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Yes, you’ve put your finger on a very delicate aspect of our work. Fortunately, we are finding ways to channel great ideas from the community into well-defined efforts to improve the platform. The prime example right now is our work to integrate Commons more tightly with Wikidata to improve discovery and to offer contributors and partners better ways of describing and organizing content (see </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2017/01/09/sloan-foundation-structured-data/"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data"><em>here</em></a><em>). </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Before we go deeper into your impressions of Commons, can you say a few words about your design philosophy and how you applied it during this assignment?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>There are two main themes in my work that come to bear here:</p>
<p><strong><em>Challenging the dominance of search as primary digital cultural interface</em></strong></p>
<p>Many of the web projects I’ve made recently focus on explorability of gigantic cultural collections. I use the prompt “what happens if there’s no search box?” to help you find things. How can you show the shape and contour of a collection to allow people to follow their nose and sniff out the things that interest them?</p>
<p><strong><em>Importance of copywriting in interface design</em></strong></p>
<p>Wiki systems are always a battle of <strong>Information vs Interface</strong>. The more functional pages you need to use the thing also take the time to explain and define themselves. It can be so <em>informative</em> it’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>Wikis are also written by many. At Flickr, I wrote a lot of the interface copy; the “system voice” was largely mine, and therefore, consistent. On Commons, you don’t know who is telling you what. This opacity can be confusing if you’re expected to follow certain rules, but don’t know who’s setting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: So what did you learn as you delved deeper into Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>It’s huge and arcane. And successful. “Anyone can contribute” means that all sorts do, and there are now about 50 million things there. That’s astonishing.</p>
<p>But, there’s very little sense of the scale or depth of the thing. It’s one thing to say there are all those things that anyone can use, but it’s another to show them all. Newbie explorers are confronted with a vast textual category system including an obscure interface element to show contents of each category… can you tell what it means?</p>
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59317" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electical-engineering-category-screenshot.png?w=323" alt="" width="323" height="383" /></div>
<p><strong><em>Categories are a beautiful disaster</em></strong></p>
<p>The various Wikipedias work so beautifully because they embrace the networked nature of information. Pages are stronger (and accepted) when they interconnect across the system. Wikipedians joke about getting “lost down the rabbit hole”, where you’re at one place at one minute then you look up an hour later and you’re somewhere completely different. This is because all of the entries are deliberately and delicately interconnected.</p>
<p>Commons is not like that. Even though there are about 6 million “<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data/About/FAQ">multi-hierarchichal</a>” categories, the majority of files are only in one category, as this 2017 research shows:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59318"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59318 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SDoC_baseline_-_Number_of_files_by_number_of_categories.png?w=1000" alt="" width="1000" height="600" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you select <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images">Images</a> at the top of the homepage, you see a list of categories of <em>types</em> of image, not <em>types of things</em> in images. That’s tricky if you’re looking for a photo of a flower and not <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_resolution">Images by Resolution</a>. There are also Topics on the homepage, which operate a little more like you’d expect. You can click on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, then explore <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chirality_in_mathematics">Chirality in Mathematics</a> or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sets_of_mathematical_objects">Sets of Mathematical Objects</a>. I was able to find what might be the best category in the history of categories though: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Potato_truncated_from_cube_to_predicate_lattice">Potato truncated from cube to predicate lattice</a>. <strong>Does that sound like a category to you?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Showing the actors</strong></em></p>
<p>I was surprised the thousands of people participating aren’t more obvious. Who’s editing what? Which people like which categories? Who is uploading a lot? Who’s helping other people? I became interested in who the admins were, how/when rules were established, and how decisions are made. If we think in terms of locals and tourists, who are the actors who know what’s happening, who I could ask for advice, or imitate?</p>
<p><em><strong>Encouraging description</strong></em></p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59319"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59319 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The_approach_of_the_spirits_.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When you get to a media file, like this fabulous <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_approach_of_the_spirits%22.png">The approach of the spirits</a>, there’s nowhere to jump across to; no way to see images like the one you’ve just discovered. Its categories are listed as <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PD-Art_(PD-US-1923)">PD-Art (PD-US-1923)</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations">Illustrations</a>. Nothing like <em>myth</em>, <em>stories</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>spirits</em>, <em>stars</em>, or <em>the night sky</em>.</p>
<p>Not being able to move sideways is a huge weakness of any hierarchical structure. It can also be difficult to navigate a hierarchy unless you know its whole structure. You’re constantly going into a branch then back out again, instead of skipping across an interconnected collection. That said, the new work on interconnected Commons infoboxes looks really promising, e.g. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Paul%27s_Cathedral">Category:St. Paul’s Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no limit to how many categories a digital object could belong to. How could the system be improved to allow more and different descriptions? As with many traditional cultural collections, an object’s metadata is revisited rarely, so instead of a live database of media like Flickr, where objects enjoy a very social existence, a thinly described object in a sea of 50 million is practically invisible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rules of engagement</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At the start of my wiki-journey, I was left to fend for myself. It felt akin to being surrounded by hungry beasts and wondering why you&#8217;re still alive&#8230;” –</em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pyfan">Pyfan</a></p>
<p>While it’s also easy or almost trite to say that Wikis are transparent democracies where anyone can participate, I also read quite a lot that people feel really intimidated when they first “come to the party”.  The category structure might also have evolved into what’s there today because the rules of engagement are dense, and the interface when you try to add or enhance things is obtuse.</p>
<p>As I did my research, I asked a few questions in the IRC channel, or on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump">Village Pump</a> (which is really well run, by the way). Answers would be presented, and be useful, but, they referenced pages that I bet would have taken me forever to find, if I could find them at all. They often displayed old “votes” or decisions made by a very few, and not revisited, or with no recourse to revisit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any tips and direct feedback for the Wikimedia Commons community?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s <em>amazing</em>!!</p>
<p>Like I said, I remain interested in the administration of the thing. In this self-governing system, how are rules created? How do those rules percolate to the newbies? How visible are they? And most importantly, who is making them?</p>
<p>There are about 225 admins for 7.2 million accounts on Commons. It’s a media library built by 7 million, but not all are editing and adding things all the time. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation suggests about <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/#/commons.wikimedia.org/contributing/editors/normal%7Cline%7C2-Year%7C~total">32,000 folks a month</a> are active, but even so, the system is administered by just 0.00003% of the population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diversity in administration / representation / arbitration</em></strong></p>
<p>I looked into who the Commons admins are, with the data to hand.[1] Here’s a graph that shows <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">how many admins were brought on each year</a>, and how many from each year “survived” as admins.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59320"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59320 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Added-and-surviving-admins.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="630" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I also looked at each admin’s page, and noted whenever I could see a declared gender (using names or photos etc). Here’s the breakdown of admin community demographics:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59322"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59322 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Admin-community-demographics.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="312" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>The geographical and language spread of the admins seems pretty good. There are people from different countries, who often also participate in their language Wikipedia and/or the EN Wikipedia, and sometimes even work for, or have worked for, the Foundation. But, even in a best case scenario (where the “unspecified” category from the pie chart was actually about 50/50 women and men, that would still be 66% men and 33% women as declared administrators. There also aren’t many new folks. This might be because the rules of engagement take a while to take in and operate at a sophisticated level. Perhaps it’s also a place to inject diversity, particularly around the things that require some kind of vote or consensus.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note at this point that Hong Kong has a police force of 34,000.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fostering diversity</em></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://seejane.org/about-us/">Geena Davis Research Institute</a> was founded in 2004 to study and shift the balance of representation of women and girls in media. Their tagline is “<em>if she can see it, she can be it</em>,” and the institute has done groundbreaking research about how to measure the presence of women and men in films, mostly, to demonstrate the presence of unconscious bias in our media. The stats are telling.</p>
<p>One of the very simple ways the institute suggests to check when you’re making a movie is that all the crowd scenes contain 50/50 women and men. I really like this. It’s easy to check and simple to do. If we apply this idea to Commons, one place to look for an “equal crowd” is the various Highlights areas, like Photo of the Day, or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Meet_our_photographers">Meet our photographers</a>. Today, those lists are mostly of men, and even some of the older admins.</p>
<p>Those public lists are a place to look for fostering more diverse representation in the community. How could the procedure for creating those lists be realigned with a positive and welcomed diversity agenda?</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing precedents</em></strong></p>
<p>During my research, I was shocked to see a photograph of a naked woman show up on the homepage of Commons, marked as Photo of the Day. I went to the Help Desk to ask “Why is OK to have a picture of a nude woman on the homepage?” I wasn’t crying OMG P0RN!, but suggesting that the image may be an alienating first image for some to encounter. It’s worth <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&amp;oldid=305803393#Why_is_it_OK_to_have_a_picture_of_a_nude_woman_on_the_home_page?">having a read</a> (and a mark of the strength of a wiki’s nature that I can retrieve the conversation). For me, it was telling that the rebuttals to my query ranged from tired responses around “pornography or art”, or that “galleries are full of naked women”, to more more resigned responses like “it’s already been decided”, or, “But this is the Internet, where the opinions of Western young men dominate, so good luck getting any sort of grown-up discussion about that.”</p>
<p>The fact that there the system is full of old decisions that are no longer questioned is a problem. You can see how it’s now handed out as a “it’s the way we’ve always done it” response here, as another helpful person <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Village_pump&amp;oldid=305254391#Objection_to_placement_of_non-notable_naked_recumbent_woman_on_homepage_today">chipped in with support for my query</a>. You can also <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_picture_candidates/File:Fine-art-nudesunpine.jpg">see the original voting process in action, in November 2013</a>, which pushed the photo of the naked woman into the picture of the day category. (Warning: you’ll also see the naked woman on that page.) Of the 18 votes cast, at least 17 of them were by men, 3 of whom were admins, many of whom have been on Commons 5+ years, and a handful of whom are also featured photographers.</p>
<p>I realise that this file and its life on Commons may be an easy target, but, it’s also indicative of the oligarchal participation and representation on Commons.</p>
<p>What if featured photographs votes require a more representative voter group? What if you, as a user, could only have 10 featured photographs? What if the “Featured” lists were removed entirely?</p>

<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the design of Wikimedia Commons in general, to make it easier to use?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>If we’re talking about making it easier to use for individuals using the web interface, then yes, I do.</p>
<p>There are just five user pages and one email in the UI that could be improved to help new folks get grounded. Making them crisp and instructional instead of information vs interface would have a huge effect. It’s about decluttering the copy and trying to help the new person figure out what to do first. The pages are <strong>User</strong>, (and <strong>welcome email</strong>), <strong>User talk</strong>, <strong>Watchlist</strong>, <strong>User contributions</strong>, and <strong>File list</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the current Welcome email, the first point of contact from the Commons to an individual:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi there [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons! Someone (probably you) from IP address 51.148.133.195, has registered an account “[Username]” with your email address here. We’re glad you decided to join us.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>What next? First you should confirm your account.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>To confirm that this account really does belong to you and activate email features on Wikimedia Commons, open this link in your browser:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>After that, you’ll see ideas on how to get started and links to help you learn about Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>From all of us here at Wikimedia Commons, welcome aboard!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>If you did *not* register the account, follow this link to cancel the email address confirmation:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>This confirmation code will expire at 13:53, 13 June 2018.</em></p>
<p>This asks more questions than it answers, and even casts doubt on me being a legitimate user! “Someone (probably you) / “to confirm this account really does belong to you…” come across as defensive and doubtful. Hardly a friendly welcome for someone new.</p>
<p>Have a look at the difference if you make it more concise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons, the world’s free media library!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Your first step is to confirm your email address, please:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Once that’s done, there are a few ways we recommend getting started:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>• Read the Policies and Guidelines of contributing to Wikimedia Commons<br />
</em><em>• Take a Photo Challenge or Upload your first media file<br />
</em><em>• Help improve information about Commons resources<br />
</em><em>• Have a look around your account settings</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Good luck! And if you get stuck, please visit the Community Help Centre.</em></p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that I have absolutely no idea how I—an interested interface designer—could independently contribute effort towards making this part of the system better, just like I can edit regular entries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Seeing each other</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the reasons I think Flickr and other social systems are so successful is because we can <em>see each other </em>when we use them. They show people their own stuff, other people’s stuff, allow them to follow/connect/gather, show the activity happening—<em>particularly on your stuff because we all love that</em>—and often, give a short list of things to try next, to show the way through. We learn from the way other people act and operate in the physical world, and that’s the same on a software platform.</p>
<p>The foundation is there on Commons to enhance representations of scale, activity, and actors to help people see each other more clearly. Improving those five core screens with these themes in mind would help locate new people in the system, and give them only as much information as they need, when they need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: And what about suggestions on how to invite more and better contributions to Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would try to make it much more obvious that viewers can improve metadata; provide much clearer calls to action to interested people. I mean, it’s somewhat implied, given that it’s a Wikimedia system, but, as far as I can tell, the call to action to improve the metadata about a file is a small Edit link next to the Summary heading on the item’s page.</p>
<p>Here’s the Pied-winged swallow, Picture of the Day on 3 September:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59358" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-piper-box.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="207" /></div>
</div>
<p>If you have the gumption to click “Edit”, you get this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59326" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-swallow-2.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="293" /></p>
<p>So, even if you wanted to add information about the image &#8212; e.g. it’s taken outside, there’s blue sky, it’s a bird, etc &#8212; you have to figure out the editing code/pseudo code and its UI. I tried to add “tag=bird” for example, and it threw an error. It’s very different from having a UI designed specifically to encourage contributions and conversation. It’s not simple. (I realise that “special” images, like Picture of the Day, have protected edit capacity to prevent vandalism.)</p>
<p>There’s a ton of uploading that happens to Commons that&#8217;s not through the UI, but with lots of other tools written to streamline the process. (That’s another strength of the system, and was at Flickr for that matter—that people can contribute to it through all sorts of interfaces.) I found myself wondering if another way to improve contributions to Commons might be to focus on the connective tissue between the various Wikimedia platforms, in the UI. If I upload an image to Commons, I could be actively prompted to create or enhance a Wikipedia page…</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have suggestions on how to make Wikimedia Commons a more interesting and useful platform for external organizations (e.g. GLAMs) to work with our communities and make their knowledge available?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would look at three main areas around usefulness for institutions:</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>Demonstrating use of collections, especially in a digital context, is especially difficult for institutions. If their stuff is nestled cosily amongst about 50 million other things, how and when can they know if the effort they’ve put in to sharing their treasures in the Commons is effective? Can any use of materials be reported on? Can that be established as new, legitimate usage of an institution’s materials? How can it be more refined, or indeed, more accurate than the mysterious “page view”. How can Commons help institutions (and individuals) see when their stuff is used? Something like the old school <a href="https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/21/2008-dopplr-per.html">Dopplr Annual Report</a>, perhaps?</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation and presence</strong></em></p>
<p>As I understand it, institutions either create a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_in_the_Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">category</a> or use <a href="http://zone47.com/crotos/?p195=2817221">a totally different system</a> to see all their media in one place. Can it provide a good destination for institutions to share around? What could their “User” page be like?</p>
<p>If you look at the Wikipedia page for a contributing institution, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum">Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, you see this little box at the bottom:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59327" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nationalmuseum-Stockholm-box.png?w=246" alt="" width="246" height="67" /></p>
<p>Even just rephrasing that to say “Explore the Nationalmuseum Stockholm’s 2,400 contributions to Wikimedia Commons” or perhaps creating another box that does that might be a start. That link also takes me to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">Category:Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, but it’s not immediately clear which items are from the collection versus about the institution.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a question about whether institutions should be treated differently in the Commons context. I’m not sure about that. Perhaps it would be better to look for a way to enhance anyone’s presence equally. If part of the claimed benefit of participating in Commons is that metadata may be improved, visibility into the material also needs to be improved. What about a link on the home page to a list that shows all of the institutions?</p>
<p><em><strong>Supporting people doing great stuff</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was doing research, I attended a Wiki-a-thon at the Wellcome Collection in London. It was a day dedicated to improving the presence of women involved in medicine on Wikipedia. There were about eight people in the room, including the Wellcome Wikimedian in Residence, Alice. It was brilliant, and I could not have created my article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Stone">Clara Stone</a> without Alice in the room. The simple act of having a living human who could explain the rules and secret doors (like, you need to make 10 edits before you can make a page) instantly made the whole process more approachable.</p>
<p>Human Wikimedian presence in cultural institutions can really help bridge the gap that’s sometimes perceived between authority and the crowd, which can be difficult for institutions to conquer on their own. This mediation is hugely valuable, and something that the Foundation could continue to support directly, and more. What if there was a Wikimedian in Residence at every national library in the world? (And lots of the smaller ones too?!?)</p>
<p>I was also surprised to discover that lots of the updates to Commons are done en masse, through scripts and other programmes developed by volunteers. What sorts of other support could the Foundation provide for these folks? How can it support this developer community even more than it does now? What new efforts and resources can be amplified to reach more potential users (both outside and within GLAMs)?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Any last thoughts on what a community-driven media repository like Wikimedia Commons could become in the future?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I was a bit surprised that this work turned out to be about representation in the end. Yes, there are simple interface changes that could be made to continue to improve usability, but there’s a huge challenge for Commons (and other huge collections online like Europeana and DPLA) to improve description of their millions of things so they’re easier to see.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">just seen in the United States</a>, oligarchies don’t like change and giving up control, but what if <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385">diversity trumps ability</a>?</p>
<p>These vast online collections will eventually see a return of the power and delicacy of curation. Only machines can consume 50 million things, and even then they might not be sure exactly what those things are, and if they find something interesting they won’t know who to tell. Computers “<a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/discovery/homo-faber">scan everything and hear nothing</a>,” so we need all kinds of humans from all over the world to help gather our histories into meaningful units, but right now, Commons is a pretty closed system.</p>
<p>Imagine if Commons could become like one of the great old cities of the world, full of all kinds of people from all kinds of places instead of a big city run by a tiny group of people who basically look the same?</p>

<p>[1] The admin data consists of two views: (1) The list on the right side of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators">Commons:Administrators</a> page, and (2) those users listed on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful requests for adminship</a>, which I edited manually to separate users who’d ever been admins from those who remain admins. Note that the total count of admins in those two views differs: (1) 225 admins, and (2) 472. I decided (2) is the more useful, but it should be stated that that’s a manually maintained list, and possibly not accurate.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Every year, the <a href="https://www.dotrust.org/">Digital Opportunity Trust</a> (DOT) hosts the Unconference &#8211; a participant-led event that convenes young social innovators hailing from several of the organization’s network countries. The Unconference grants youths the opportunity to connect with professionals, mentors, and one another, bringing over 100 individuals from several countries to share their innovation experiences. From Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Indigenous Canada, DOT works with governments, the private sector and community-based organizations to support youth striving to transform their societies as social innovators, digital ambassadors, and leaders.</p>
<p>This year, the conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya and centered around the theme of inclusivity &#8211; specifically, closing the gender gap in technology. The first morning plenary session was opened by DOT CEO and founder, Janet Longmore, who spoke on the rise of social entrepreneurship, innovation and business. “Think about how you can contribute in the world of humanity, because the challenge we face cannot be solved with one or two individuals,” Longmore said. “A way to truly create an inclusive world is through passion, skill, and talent of social innovators.”</p>
<p>And passionate, talented social innovators we met! DIAL had the privilege to learn about several individuals and their journeys to create and apply digital solutions to achieve positive social change in their communities. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelChatina">Emmanuel Chatina</a> has developed a social enterprise that leverages mobile phones to offer remote healthcare to those who would otherwise not have ready access to health providers.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356904" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Others are addressing the invisible form of health and seek to destigmatize dialogue surrounding it. Eunice Njeghe, Angela Mumbi, Walder Amani, and Latifa Noor promote mental health and connect individuals in Kenya to mental health providers through their mobile application, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeingPsych">PsychBeing</a>, while Yvonne Osagie from Ottawa is currently developing an online platform devoted to education, support, and prevention of sexual abuse on college campuses.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356951" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356989" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>And digital technologies are not only being used, but taught: in addition to training young girls and women in the latest technologies, Ivy Barley, co-founder of <a href="https://developersinvogue.org/">Developers in Vogue</a>, helps them navigate the tech space and connects them to real-time projects and jobs, doing her part in closing the gender divide in tech.</p>
<p>As we learned about the different ways in which digital technology extends social services to traditionally underserved communities across multiple geographies and sectors, we also had the opportunity to introduce many of the participants to the <a href="digitalprinciples.org">Digital Principles</a> and share how the Principles can help guide their work and achieve sustainability. Participants who attended our Digital Principles session shared the challenges they face when implementing their solutions, the resources they wish they had available, and how they believed the Principles could be helpful in addressing these issues. Many insights shared by participants showcased common problems in the ICT sector and demonstrated how it is never too early to begin putting the Principles into practice.</p>
<p>The Unconference was an incredibly powerful and inspiring experience; we look forward to having DOT youths’ voices join and help shape the future of the Digital Principles as they continue to develop into tomorrow’s innovators and leaders bringing digital solutions to global communities.</p>

        <p>When you think about the work of art historians or genetics researchers, installing database software is not the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, from 19 to 21 September, Wikimedians, art curators, and scientists <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2018-09-19-21-New-York">gathered at the New Museum</a> in New York City’s Lower East Side for a three-day workshop to talk about an emerging technology designed to make storing and structuring data free and accessible. The focal point was an increasingly vital piece of the Wikimedia ecosystem that makes linked data possible for everyone: Wikibase.</p>
<p>Wikibase is a little-known standalone piece of software that powers Wikimedia’s popular new linked-data project <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>.  (This is similar to how Wikipedia is powered by a general wiki software called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, which is used everywhere from NASA to MuppetWiki.)  Since 2012, Wikidata has been growing to fill an increasingly important role in the Wikimedia community: connecting, sharing and providing tools for turning Wikipedia’s text strings into useful, searchable, machine-readable.  Wikidata’s content informs research and cultural heritage institutions, as well as digital tools like Google’s Knowledge Graph. None of this would be possible without Wikibase—which makes the Wikidata’s linked open data project possible and practical.</p>
<p>In the last few years, an expanding community of researchers, GLAMs, and other knowledge communities have been experimenting with using Wikibase for their own repositories of knowledge, distinct from the central Wikidata knowledge collected by Wikimedians. But this nascent community of Wikibase reusers is just emerging, and deploying an open source technology not originally designed for third-party use can be challenging.</p>
<p>The September Wikidata workshop gathered a subgroup of these pioneering data explorers to better understand how to realize Wikibase as a robust independent project distinct from the Wikidata platform, and to turn it into a tool that can offer core infrastructure for the work of scholars and GLAMs as they collect, describe and analyze their diverse stores of both facts and artifacts.  The key question: how could Wikibase reach and meet the needs of professionals across a broad community of emerging and established institutions.</p>
<p>The gathering was made possible through a generous grant by the Sloan Foundation.  It was hosted and sponsored by one of the early adopters of this technology, <a href="http://rhizome.org">Rhizome</a> (documented in our Many Faces of Wikibase <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">blog series</a>), and co-organized with <a href="https://wikimedia.de/en">Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</a>.</p>
<h3>What do you talk about in a Wikibase workshop?</h3>
<p>The Wikibase workshop began with talks by participants highlighting their work in the realms of Wikidata, Wikibase, and more generally representing and working with linked data. Participants came with varying levels of experience with Wikidata and Wikibase, from interested newcomers to intrepid early adopters of the technology.  So, the presentations created an important baseline understanding of what is happening with Wikibase and what its possibilities and pain points are.</p>
<p>Day one explored both the many opportunities and the number of underlying concerns exploring and integrating a new technology. Are we the only ones experiencing challenges? Are there tools that could help us solve our problems? What kind of future can we build for increasing adoption of the software?</p>
<p>At the same time presenters brought striking examples of advanced use.  Digital art specialists described how they use Wikimedia tools for art preservation <em>Rhizome </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">using Wikibase</a>, and <em>SFMOMA</em> using Mediawiki. Michigan State University’s <a href="http://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> and Pratt University’s <a href="https://linkedjazz.org/">Linked Jazz Project</a> showed off the <a href="https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/wikibase-for-research-infrastructure-part-1-d3f640dfad34">power of wikibase and linked data for exploring the cultural record</a>.  GLAM professionals from the Smithsonian, New York’s METRO library consortium, and York University highlighted the potential applications of Wikidata to their own varied and vast collections spaces.</p>
<p>During the second day, we broke into working groups focused on understanding practical ways which Wikibase can be better supported for arts and research communities. Tracks focused on UI/UX improvements, making Wikibase easier to install and use, developing a Wikibase community, improving data modeling on Wikibase. The groups each provided <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/s/LOD-Wikibase-Summit-NYC">pages of documentation and specific recommendations</a> that can be used as part of Wikibase’s development going forward (including, for example, <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/zMnfc5tPTwa8ajcUiTzPQA?both">concept sketches</a> for changes to the platform that would help GLAM and humanities researchers use Wikibase).</p>
<p>By day three, the community in the room had a strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose: that we can imagine are future in which Wikibase powers GLAM and research institutions to strengthen the exchange and connection of knowledge. We wrapped up the workshop with a session of sharing and reflecting, and then finished documenting the event, with next steps and links to notes on the conference meetup page, technical feature requests on phabricator tickets, and this very blog post.</p>
<h3>It’s more than just gathering together—it’s about creating a community</h3>
<p>An overwhelming theme throughout the workshop was the questions of, <em>what’s next</em>? In the wrapup conversations, the answers came back to facilitating a growing community of users who want to apply the Wikibase technology to the work of researchers and GLAMs. Key to forming the community would be figuring out what stories we can tell, and how we can tell them to new audiences.</p>
<p>Most of the participants in the New York Workshop were new users of Wikibase—very much still learning. In a community-driven environment like Wikimedia, sometimes the best outcome of an event is developing a larger community of knowledge-holders, of individuals able to explain, support and facilitate understanding of a practice or set of projects. With the Wikibase workshop, we helped a larger group of community members share their knowledge and gain knowledge from others. So, the next time a question arises on the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug">Wikibase users mailing list</a>, or a colleague expresses as interest in Wikibase, they know who else to connect with. In short: the workshop helped produce more nodes in our growing Wikibase linked data network.</p>
<p>This budding community would not have been able to form without the amazing facilitation of Dragan Espenschied (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111053">Q111053</a> on Wikidata) from Rhizome and Sandra Müllrick from Wikimedia Deutschland, along with their teams.  The organizers facilitated a collegial, knowledge exchange that can lead to a growing web of Wikibase users and community participants.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom - October 24, 2018</strong></p> <p>2ndQuadrant today announced the release of <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/repmgr/">repmgr 4.2</a> This release includes support for PostgreSQL 11, the newest major release announced by the community last week.</p> <p>repmgr is the most popular tool for PostgreSQL replication and failover management. It enhances and complements the built-in replication capabilities in PostgreSQL; making it easy to set up and manage standby servers, check replication status, and perform administrative tasks such as switchover operations. The repmgrd daemon provides automatic failover capability to maximize database uptime, and can easily be integrated with other tools such as PgBouncer for high application availability.</p> <p>The principal new feature of repmgr 4.2 is the ability to "pause" the repmgr daemon (repmgrd) via the <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-pause.html">repmgr daemon pause</a> and the corresponding <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-unpause.html">repmgr daemon unpause</a> commands. These will temporarily prevent it from taking failover action. This is useful for activities like planned maintenance (e.g. database upgrades or switchovers) which previously required repmgrd to be shut down on all nodes. <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-standby-switchover.html">repmgr standby switchover</a> will automatically pause/unpause repmgrd, simplifying switchover operations. </p> <p>Additionally, the new <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgr-daemon-status.html">repmgr daemon status</a> command is available to provide an overview of repmgrd status on all nodes.</p> <p>For more details on this functionality, see the detailed <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/repmgrd-pausing.html">documentation</a>.</p> <p>repmgr 4.2 also provides several usability enhancements:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter shutdown_check_timeout (default: 60 seconds).</strong> This provides an explicit timeout for repmgr standby switchover to check that the demotion candidate (current primary) has shut down. </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Add new parameter repmgr_ bindir.</strong> This facilitates remote invocation of repmgr when the repmgr binary is located somewhere other than the PostgreSQL binary directory, as it cannot be assumed all package maintainers will install repmgr there. This parameter is optional; if not set (default), repmgr will fall back to pg_ bindir (if set).</p> </li> <li> <p>repmgr cluster cleanup now accepts the --node-id option to delete records for only one node.</p> </li> <li> <p>When running repmgr cluster matrix and repmgr cluster crosscheck, repmgr will report nodes unreachable via SSH, and emit return code ERR_BAD_SSH. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For a detailed list of all changes, please read the complete release notes <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/dev/release-4.2.html">here</a>.</p> <p>Upgrade instructions are available <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/upgrading-repmgr-extension.html#UPGRADING-MAJOR-VERSION">here</a>.</p> <p>Packages and installation documentation are available via 2ndQuadrant’s public RPM and APT repositories from 2ndQuadrant <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation-packages.html">here</a>.</p> <p>Source files can be downloaded <a href="https://repmgr.org/download/repmgr-4.2.tar.gz">here</a> and installation instructions are available <a href="https://repmgr.org/docs/4.2/installation.html">here</a>.</p> <p>repmgr is distributed under GPL v3.</p> <p>For more information, please send an email to <a href="info@2ndQuadrant.com">info@2ndQuadrant.com</a></p>

Per aquest motiu, està dissenyat per facilitar-los la iniciació mitjançant un conjunt de tasques, que proveeixen organitzacions com el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic. Els preuniversitaris seleccionen les tasques i les treballen amb l’ajut d’un mentor durant vàries setmanes. Cada tasca té una durada de 3 a 5 hores i els estudiants disposen de 3 dies per acabar-la i després, si ho volen, continuar amb una de nova.<br /><br />Les tasques són de 5 tipus diferents i no únicament de programació, la qual cosa amplia a tots els escolars la possibilitat de presentar-s’hi. Al tractar-se d’un programa mundial, totes les preguntes, respostes i comunicacions es fan en anglès.<br /><br /><img height="139" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1WhH2ptYnjIoseZjQKliUhEftPNqsmIIrjRYsfoPn5ANAoi3daUCEBdJwUp4oC2_viPu7a1v20kvOg5GiL39l_EzdL6eN_9bzHuho5OknZR4zCfvodIPJd4gOypZqEvA_K_oPS-C" width="640" /><br /><br />El concurs està dotat amb diversos premis, que depenen del nombre de tasques que finalitzin i de quantes en facin els estudiants: des de diplomes de Google (1 tasca), samarretes (3 o més tasques), assuadores ii, fins i tot, guanyar un viatge a la central de Google, situada a Silicon Valley (Califòrnia), amb un familiar o tutor.<br /><br />Des del 2010, més de 4.500 estudiants de 99 països han participat en el programa Google Code-in. El Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic va gestionar el passat concurs 2017-2018 més de 500 estudiants de tot el món, entre els quals hi havia vàries dotzenes de lleidatans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Objectius </b>Que nenes i nens de Lleida i arreu del mòn aconsegueixin una experiència mundial única i amb una marca tan reconeguda com Google mitjançant la participació en aquesta nova edició. El Parc Científic, a través del seu laboratori Liquid Galaxy LAB, és un dels dissenyadors del programa. <br /><br /><b>Dates </b>El proper 23 d’octubre comença el termini per registrar-se i seleccionar les tasques a desenvolupar a través de la web <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">https://codein.withgoogle.com/</a>. <br />El concurs finalitza el 12 de desembre del 2018. Els estudiants necessiten un compte de Google per accedir-hi i un permís parental, que se’ls demana al registrar-se. Els participants han d’esperar que Google aprovi el permís abans de desenvolupar les tasques.<br /><br /><br /><b>Responsables </b>El Liquid Galaxy LAB, laboratori TIC del Parc Científic sota la coordinació d’Andreu Ibáñez i amb la col·laboració del Grup de Desenvolupadors Google de Lleida (GDG Lleida). Darrera hi ha un equip de 30 mentors de tot el món, que atenen els estudiants.<br /><br /><b>Contacte: lgcodein@gmail.com </b>

      <h5>2018-10-18T17:00:39.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Melody Kramer</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The news that optical physicist Donna Strickland <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/04/donna-strickland-wikipedia/">did not have a Wikipedia page</a> before winning the Nobel Prize in Physics brought renewed attention to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">Women in Red</a>, a long-standing volunteer effort to add more biographies about women to the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After the announcement, the Women in Red WikiProject had one of their best weeks ever, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_Stephenson-Goodknight">Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight</a>, the co-founder of Women in Red.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://denelezh.dicare.org/evolution.php?project=enwiki">Statistics [&#8230;] show</a> an increase in the number of women’s biographies during the week immediately after the Nobel Prize announcement,” she said. “I’ve also seen a dramatic increase [in interest] on social media.”</p>
<p>The news that more people are interested in contributing biographies about women to Wikipedia is gratifying to Stephenson-Goodnight, who co-founded Women in Red in 2015 after learning that only 15 percent of biographies on Wikipedia at the time were about women. (That number has since jumped to 17.67 percent, meaning an average of 72 new articles on women were added to English Wikipedia every single day for the past 3.5 years.)</p>
<p>In the past three years, Women in Red has collaborated with outside institutions like museums and libraries that want to put on edit-a-thons, and developed lists of “redlinks”—non-existing Wikipedia articles—of women who should have material written about them. But the group doesn’t stop at biographies.</p>
<p>“Our scope includes women&#8217;s works (such as the paintings they painted, the schools the founded, the conferences they convened), as well as women&#8217;s issues (such as women&#8217;s suffrage and women&#8217;s health),” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>A helpful space for newcomers</h3>
<p>Women in Red is known for helping newcomers navigate the technical rules of Wikipedia—which can be overwhelming for new contributors. Sue Barnum, a volunteer Librarian-in-Residence with Women in Red, points to the group’s friendly and helpful nature as a key reason why it has been so successful.</p>
<p>“We support one another and help each other with our articles, references and technical details. If you need help, we&#8217;re going to help or find someone who can,” she says. “I&#8217;ll try to help people get access to articles or books behind paywalls. Sometimes I&#8217;ll even go to nearby libraries to access the actual book to help people verify their sources if the book or journal is only available offline.”</p>
<h3>The focus is on why women matter</h3>
<p>Editor SusunW, a founding member of Women in Red, recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/Blog">wrote an essay</a> about why she focuses on writing about women on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“I learn as much from writing women’s biographies as I impart from telling their stories,” she writes. “For example, in the pre-internet world, the international links between people and the organizations in which they participated were much stronger than you might imagine. The analytical part of researching the interconnections, and reward of working with editors who want to improve articles, is a motivating factor to me—as is the hope that the women in generations who follow will grow up knowing that women have always been actively involved in the world around them and were not passively allowing the world to go by.”</p>
<p>Making women—and their role in history—more visible is a motivating factor for many participants to Women in Red.</p>
<p>“I grew up believing that women didn&#8217;t do anything interesting,” says Barnum. “It&#8217;s sad that I believed that, because it isn&#8217;t true. I believed this because women&#8217;s contributions become invisible, especially after their deaths. There are many articles I&#8217;ve worked on where a woman was quite nationally famous during her lifetime, but after she dies, she somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; to make it into the canon that describes the subject she was involved in. This is really tragic and I&#8217;m glad that there are historians out there writing about women who have been hidden in history.”</p>
<p><strong>You can make a difference</strong></p>
<p>Inspired to join Women in Red?  There are many ways to get involved. For starters, Women in Red has put together a p<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Primer_for_creating_women%27s_biographies">rimer for creating women&#8217;s biographies&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Women_in_Red">&#8220;ten Simple Rules for Creating Women&#8217;s Biographies&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to jump in, Barnum recommends starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Redlist_index">the lists</a> that Women in Red has put together on women that are notable by Wikipedia’s standards and who need biographies written about them.</p>
<p>“Pick someone from a subject area you enjoy writing about and then make sure you have several reliable sources to backup your writing,” she says.</p>
<p>SusunW adds that you don’t necessarily need to start with a full biography. “If there do not appear to be sufficient sources to add a standalone biography on a woman, she can be added to events she participated in and organizations she was involved with, provided reliable sourcing can confirm her activities.”</p>
<p>For example, if a woman participated in an academic conference, adding her name to the list of participants—with proper sourcing—may help someone write a biography about her at a later date.</p>
<p>And Stephenson-Goodnight says you can always update an existing article. “Add a reference, add an internal link to another article, fix the punctuation, or improve the opening paragraph,” she says.</p>
<h3>If you need help</h3>
<p>Don’t be overwhelmed if you start to edit and find yourself confused. There are many ways to get help! You can post on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">talk page of  Women in Red</a>, as well as the talk pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rosiestep">Rosie</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Megalibrarygirl">Sue</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SusunW">SusunW</a>. (A talk page is like a message board where people communicate about a topic or article.)</p>
<p>“If you get stuck or have questions, remember that all of us were new once and others helped us, so we&#8217;re glad to respond to your questions,” says Stephenson-Goodnight. “You can also reach me via Twitter or Facebook or email.”</p>
<p>And if you’d rather work with people in person, there are opportunities for that too.</p>
<p>“If you live near a city which has a Wikimedia Affiliate (Chapter, Thematic Organization, or User Group), check in with them regarding their events schedule. There&#8217;s an international list available on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup">this Meetup page</a>. Or ask us at Women in Red to assist you in the search,” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>Helping beyond editing</h3>
<p>And one last thing: you don’t need to edit Wikipedia to meaningfully contribute to Women in Red. You can tweet or post about new articles on social media (including the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiwomeninred">@WikiWomenInRed</a>), help find archival material, or help access photos that are licensed properly.</p>
<p>“Having people who are willing to reach out to individuals to secure a license for a picture to be used on Commons is very helpful,” says Barnum. “Others may have access to archives or books that are offline and can help provide access to other editors.”</p>
<p>And your work—whether an edit, a tweet, or a photo—is meaningful, and makes a difference <em>on </em>Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“We are making a difference, one article at a time, making for incremental corrections to the systemic bias depicted in the written canon,” says Stephenson-Goodknight. “I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything more worthwhile with my free time.”</p>

      <h5>2018-10-18T17:00:00.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Katherine Maher</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>This post ran in the </em>Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-maher-wikipedia-gender-bias-20181018-story.html"><em>on 18 October 2018</em></a>.</p>
<p>When Donna Strickland won the Nobel Prize this month, she became only the third woman in history to receive the award in physics. An optical physicist at the University of Waterloo, Strickland is brilliant, accomplished and inspiring. To use Wikipedia parlance, she is very clearly notable.</p>
<p>Except that, somehow, she wasn’t. Despite her groundbreaking research on a method of generating laser beams with ultrashort pulses, Strickland did not have a Wikipedia page until shortly after her Nobel win.</p>
<p>Perhaps more disconcerting, a volunteer Wikipedia editor had drafted a page about Strickland in March only to have it declined in May. The reason: There wasn’t enough coverage of Strickland’s work in independent secondary sources to establish her notability. Her achievements simply weren’t documented in enough news articles that Wikipedia editors could cite.</p>
<p>Before Wikipedia points a finger that might rightly be pointed back at us, let me acknowledge that Wikipedia’s shortcomings are absolutely real. Our contributors are majority Western and mostly male, and these gatekeepers apply their own judgment and prejudices. As a result, Wikipedia has dozens of articles about battleships and not nearly enough on poetry. We’ve got comprehensive coverage on college football but significantly less on African marathoners.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wikipedia is by design a living, breathing thing—a collection of knowledge that many sources, in aggregate, say is worth knowing. It is therefore a reflection of the world’s biases more than it is a cause of them.</p>
<p>We are working to correct biases in Wikipedia’s coverage. For instance, in 2014, Wikipedia editors evaluated all the biographies on English Wikipedia and found that only about 15% of them were about women. To rectify the imbalance, groups of volunteers, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_scientists">WikiProject Women Scientists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">WikiProject Women in Red</a>, have been identifying women who should have pages and creating articles about them.</p>
<p>Today, 17.82% of our biographies are about women. This near 3% jump may not sound like much, but it represents 86,182 new articles. That works out to 72 new articles a day, every single day, for the past three and a half years.</p>
<p>But signs of bias pop up in different ways. A 2015 study found that, on English Wikipedia, the word “divorced” appears more than four times as often in biographies of women than in biographies of men. We don’t fully know why, but it’s likely a multitude of factors, including the widespread tendency throughout history to describe the lives of women through their relationships with men.</p>
<p>Technology can help identify such problems. Wikipedia articles about health get close attention from our community of medical editors, but for years, some articles on critical women’s health issues, such as breastfeeding, languished under a “low importance” categorization. An algorithm identified this mistake.</p>
<p>But there is only so much Wikipedia itself can do. To fix Wikipedia’s gender imbalance, we need our contributors and editors to pay more attention to the accomplishments of women. This is true across all under-represented groups: people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Although we don’t believe that only women editors should write pages about other women, or writers of color about people of color, we do think that a broader base of contributors and editors—one that included more women and people of color, among others—would naturally help broaden our content.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is founded on the concept that every individual should be able to share freely in the sum of all knowledge. We believe in “knowledge equity,” <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction">which we define</a> as as the idea that diverse forms of knowledge should be recognized and respected. Wikipedia is not limited to what fits into a set of encyclopedias.</p>
<p>We also need other fields to identify and document diverse talent. If journalists, book publishers, scientific researchers, curators, academics, grant-makers and prize-awarding committees don’t recognize the work of women, Wikipedia’s editors have little foundation on which to build.</p>
<p>Increasingly, Wikipedia’s content and any biases therein have ramifications well beyond our own website. For instance, Wikipedia is now relied upon as a major source in the training of powerful artificial intelligence models, including models that underlie common technologies we all use.</p>
<p>In such training processes, computers ingest large data sets, draw inferences from patterns in the data and then generate predictions. As is well understood in the programming world, bad or incomplete data generate biased outcomes. This phenomenon is known by the acronym GIGO: garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>People may intuitively understand that Wikipedia is a perennial work in progress. Computers, on the other hand, simply process the data they’re given. If women account for only 17.82% of the data, we may find ourselves with software that thinks women are only 17.82% of what matters in the world.</p>
<p>It is true that Wikipedia has a problem if Donna Strickland, an accomplished physicist, is considered worthy of a page only when she receives the highest possible recognition in her field. But this problem reflects a far more consequential and intractable problem in the real world.</p>
<p>Wikipedia would like to encourage other knowledge-generating institutions to join us in our efforts to balance this inequity. We may not be able to change how society values women, but we can change how women are seen, and ensure that they are seen to begin with. That’s a start.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/worlddataforum.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17262 alignleft" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/worlddataforum.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="388" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/worlddataforum.jpg 375w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/worlddataforum-290x300.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>How has mobile network data been used to inform policy? What building blocks need to be in place to leverage mobile phone network data for real-time policy analysis, decision making and impact tracking? UN Global Pulse and the Digital Impact Alliance are excited to host a joint-session at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai to explore the operational aspects of using mobile phone network data as a public good. At the event, we are bringing various actors from government, UN Agencies, Mobile Network Operators and NGOs to share their research and on-the-ground experience of using mobile network data to inform decision making around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for humanitarian action.</p>
<p>With more than 5 billion people connected to mobile services in 2017 and projections of reaching 5.9 billion by 2025, or 71 per cent of the world’s population, the mobile phone sector has become increasingly important in helping achieve the SDGs. While the mobile industry has made great strides in supporting the SDGs, we are still far from realizing its full impact. A critical piece of the mobile industry’s impact lies in the data it generates for analysis, which governments, humanitarian and development organizations, and donors agree would be extremely beneficial to address key humanitarian issues and reach the SDGs by 2030.</p>
<p>Anonymised mobile network data contains information about population characteristics such as movements, density, location, social patterns, and finances. As this data is uniquely detailed and tractable, it can capture information not easily found from other sources at a scale that would be difficult to recreate through other means. Once anonymized and aggregated to appropriate levels, this data can provide a variety of insights with tremendous value for development partners, including but not limited to mobility, social interaction, and economic activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unglobalpulse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Pulse</a> has developed a series of proof-of-concepts for the use of mobile network data for public good, including tracking food security, informing disaster management and understanding seasonal migration, among others. We’re working not only with mobile operators around the world, but also with their industry trade organization, the GSMA. In 2017, GSMA established an explicit strategy around putting anonymiszed mobile big data to work for the public good. There are currently 19 mobile operators who are committed to the Big Data for Social Good initiative. This is exciting for us because it shows how data philanthropy could work at an industry-wide scale, rather than with just one partner at a time.</p>
<p>We also strive to catalyse the use of big data for public policy and humanitarian action by advancing normative frameworks and delivering learning experiences for policy makers across the world via our network of labs. At the World Data Forum, we hope to showcase some of our work in the South Pacific with Digicel and the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, informing responses to natural disasters in these contexts and shaping our thinking on how to scale this work, as well as share the experiences of our colleagues at ITU who are using mobile network data to better understand the development of information societies.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/what-we-do/data-for-development-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIAL’s Data for Development</a> portfolio focuses on unlocking the value of private sector data (including mobile network data) in a safe, standardized manner, utilizing technical, commercial and governance-driven innovation to help achieve impact and sustainability. DIAL is working with a global network of partners including country governments, mobile network operators, technology solutions providers, donors and implementation organizations to support the building and scaling of data-driven solutions to meet the SDGs. DIAL also provides capital and operational support for development and deployment of reusable digital building blocks (e.g. software platforms, data analytics tools) that are designed once but that can be tailored to fit unique sectoral and geographical needs. This October, DIAL will share updates and key learnings from our work in Uganda and Malawi, our platform investments, and from global research by inviting our key partners to share their experiences. While each of these projects has been different in terms of focus and lessons learnt, we’ve also identified high-level synthesis items at the ecosystem level, which are helping us understand what is needed to bring the use of mobile data to scale.</p>
<p>UNGP and DIAL are excited to co-host this panel given the overlap of our work and the recognition that in order to scale and sustain the use of mobile network data, we must share what we’ve learned so far and increase collaborative efforts. The UN World Data Forum provides a great opportunity to elevate the conversation so that we, as a data community, can work together to make the use of mobile network data more systemic and sustainable.</p>
<p>We hope you join our session and bring forth your ideas so that we can further develop practices and models that safely and responsibly use mobile data for public good.</p>

      <i class="author">McKensie Mack</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Maybe you&#8217;ve already heard the story of how the global edit-a-thon known as <strong><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/">Art+Feminism</a></strong> got started. It goes something like this:</p>
<p>Five years ago, four friends—Siân Evans, Jacqueline Mabey, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak—gathered together to discuss an idea for promoting Wikipedia as a place to challenge one of the ways women are silenced: through the preservation of information. That discussion became the Art+Feminism campaign.</p>
<p>Our goals today still revolve around combating gender inequity on the internet, using Wikipedia as a tool for correcting the written record on cis and trans women. And in the last year, all of us—from the leadership collective to the thousands of organizers, artists, librarians, activists, and editors who make up our global Art+Feminism community—have experienced many lessons, challenges, and triumphs.</p>
<p>Take the month of March, for example. Over 4,000 people at more than 315 Art+Feminism events around the world came together to create or improve nearly 22,000 pages on Wikipedia, with a total of 43,000 content pages created or improved! That’s <em>four</em> times the output of our 2017 events. Four times. Out of 357 initiatives across 80 countries, we were named as 1 of 5 finalists in the <a href="https://twitter.com/equals/status/1041695010339606528">#EQUALSinTech</a> Leadership Award Category.</p>
<p>Our fifth-annual <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/3941">Wikipedia edit-a-thon at the Museum of Modern Art</a>, an all-day event designed to generate coverage of feminism and the arts on Wikipedia, took place on 3 March 2018 with hundreds of partner events around the world. It featured tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, ongoing editing support, training on combating implicit and explicit biases, reference materials, childcare, and refreshments, with the leading panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcd1lfZ4ws">“Careful with Each Other, Dangerous Together,”</a> about the relationship between structures of inequality on the internet, the emotional labor of internet activism, and creating inclusive online communities with Caroline Sinders, Sydette Harry, Salome Asega, and Sarah Jaffe.</p>
<p>Art+Feminism’s regional organizers continue to amplify the way the project resonates with and reaches people all over the world. This year, <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/05/tentaciones/1522922021_036290.html">we focused on Latin America</a>, where Melissa Tamani has done concentrated outreach, quadrupling the number of events in that region compared to last year.  These nearly 30 events stretched from Laboratorio Cultural del Norte, Chihuahua, Mexico, to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59270"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59270" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ArtAndFeminism-MoMA18-14-Panel.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">Panel discussion about Art+Feminism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York City, 3 March 2018.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>Our success is because of the commitment that we share with hundreds of organizers around the world to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/15/wikipedia-edit-a-thon-women-arts">the voices of cis and trans women made visible</a> and their achievements shared just as widely as their male identified peers. We want to see justice done and each year,  we work to refine our strategies, our organizing, and our materials so that they are made even more accessible than the year before. With that goal in mind, we launched our <em><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/organizing-kit/">Quick Guide for Organizers</a></em> and our <em><a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org/editing-kit/">Quick Guide for (New) Editors</a></em>. Both guides have been made available on our training materials page in English and Spanish. On 30 September of this year, we are launching our redesigned training guides for organizers in PPT form in English and Spanish with more guides to follow translated into French and at least one African language with the goal of translating our materials for new editors and organizers into at least five additional languages in the next three years of our campaign. In addition to content focused on quick tips for organizing edit-a-thons and editing Wikipedia for the first time; we’ll be launching even more materials in the future focused specifically on advancing gender justice on the internet, designing brave/safe space policies through a lens knowledge equity and anti-harassment, and more.</p>
<p>Beginning this project, we knew that our role would not only be to empower cis and trans women to edit online but to stand with them as they are challenged by those who do not see value in their perspective nor value in them. Art+Feminism is about making Wikipedia a more complete and representative source of information, but it doesn’t end there for us. It’s about dismantling systems of thought that diminish or erase entirely the place marginalized people and their communities have in our history.</p>
<p>As we have addressed many glaring omissions about women on Wikipedia, we have seen our focus turn towards improving existing articles: for example, the first year we created 101 new articles, and improved roughly the same number, while this year we improved 7 times as many articles as we created.</p>
<p>Our task is to take what we’ve made to the next level. From there, our task is to leverage the reach and impact of our social justice community to recognize that Wikipedia is just one of many tools that can be used to combat gender inequity and biased, informative content on the internet. We have so much to do, and we’re ready to take on the task of continuing to iterate and improve as our campaign evolves and adapts as it needs to.</p>
<p>Look at what we’ve done—and there&#8217;s even more to come.</p>

Making graphs is easy. Making intuitive, easy-to-understand graphs? It&#8217;s harder than most people think. At the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, the ISTE-260 (Designing the User Experience) course teaches the language of design to IT students. For an introductory exercise in the class, students are tasked to visualize any set of data they desire. Students <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkim18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Kim</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jathan-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jathan Anandham</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinwflory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin W. Flory</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-tinker-216962129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Tinker</a> used the MusicBrainz database to look at how five different Queen songs went mainstream in different ways.


<span id="more-7209"></span>

<h2>Five factors of Queen</h2>


Our mini data science experiment decided to look at five unique data points available to us via <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz Works</a>:


<ul>
 	<li>Number of recorded covers</li>
 	<li>Number of artists who covered a song</li>
 	<li>Release year</li>
 	<li>Year of last recorded cover</li>
 	<li>Time elapsed between release year and year of last recorded cover</li>
</ul>


Originally, we looked at songs from different artists, but decided to look at five recordings from the same artist. With Queen being a notoriously famous band, there were several data points to work with in terms of how often a song was covered.

<h2>Making sense of the data</h2>


A few explanations are necessary for some of the data, especially the difference in number of covers and number of artists. <em>Don&#8217;t Stop Me Now</em>, <em>Fat Bottomed Girls</em>, and <em>We Will Rock You</em> had the same number of recorded covers as number of artists who have covered the song. Why were <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> and <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> different?



As it turns out, <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> had more covers than the number of artists who have covered the song. This happens because some artists have covered the song twice (e.g. once on a studio release and another on a live recording release). On the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody had more artists covering it than number of covers because some recordings featured multiple artists on the same cover (e.g. the 1992 live performance with Elton John and Axl Rose).



The data opens many interesting questions. Why have some songs persisted longer than others (in terms of recent covers)? Have these songs impacted culture and society in different ways? How have they permeated culture? Is there geographical bias in the data?



This exercise was an exploratory assignment, but we had fun visualizing it and ended up learning an interesting pattern in music data.

        <p>We are pleased to announce a $2 million gift to the Wikimedia Endowment from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros">George Soros</a>, one of the world&#8217;s leading philanthropists.</p>
<p>Soros is known for his extensive philanthropy to <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wall-street-donors/george-soros.html">support ideals underpinning a free and open society</a>, including access to knowledge, education, economic development and policy reform. He is also known for founding the Open Society Foundations, one of the preeminent international grantmaking networks supporting civil society groups around the world, and giving over $32 billion of his personal wealth to the organization.</p>
<p>“George’s generous gift to the future of free knowledge is reflective of his deep commitment to supporting openness in all its forms” said Katherine Maher, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation. “His gift will help us ensure the sum of all knowledge remains free and open for the benefit of generations to come.”</p>
<p>This gift provides vital momentum to the Wikimedia Endowment Campaign. Wikimedia believes that free knowledge is the foundation for human potential, opportunity, and freedom. Since the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikipedia_celebrates_15_years_of_free_knowledge">launch of the endowment in January 2016</a>, the campaign has raised over $26.5 million from generous donors, philanthropists, and Wikimedia community members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Endowment is not just a practical way to support Wikipedia,&#8221; Soros says. &#8220;My gift represents a commitment to the ideals of open knowledge—and to the long-term importance of free knowledge sources that benefit people around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The Wikimedia Endowment guarantees that the next generation of Wikipedia readers and contributors will have even better educational opportunities than the previous generations had,” said Peter Baldwin, co-founder of the Arcadia Fund, Wikimedia Endowment Board member, and long-time supporter. “Time and again George has been a philanthropic leader in ensuring access and opportunity around the world, and his gift to the endowment furthers that for generations to come.”</p>

      <i class="author">Srishti Sethi and Sarah Rodlund</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We’re always looking for ways to strengthen the open source ecosystem. Over the past two months, the Developer Advocacy team at the Wikimedia Foundation collaborated with two open source initiatives: Mozilla’s <a href="https://opensource.mozilla.community/">Open Source Student Network (OSSN)</a> and TeachingOpenSource.org&#8217;s <a href="http://foss2serve.org/index.php/POSSE">Professors&#8217; Open Source Software Experience</a>  (TOS and POSSE, respectively). OSSN is designed to bring more students into open source projects, while POSSE aims to provide more professional development resources for professors.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s pilot project, which is currently underway at colleges in the United States and Canada, aims to help university students find suitable open source projects to engage with. Before its launch, Mozilla researched the state of open source on college campuses, as well as criteria that students might consider in choosing a project. Based on this research, Mozilla developed <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/cracking-the-code-how-mozilla-is-helping-university-students-contribute-to-open-source-25fa630d8c5c">an overview template for project selection</a> that presents the four most relevant (and often not properly surfaced) criteria at a glance: the mission of the project, technology, time needed for setting up the development environment, and how to connect with the community.</p>
<p>POSSE, meanwhile, provides professional development experience to professors interested in teaching open source through Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects. POSSE began as an outreach effort by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat</a> to the higher education community.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, our team, met with the contributors to the Mozilla’s Open Source Student Network (OSSN) and POSSE initiative at the <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/">LibrePlanet conference</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We saw an opportunity to further support student contributors on the Wikimedia projects by collaborating with these two initiatives.</p>
<p>There are two primary reasons why we are excited about this collaboration.</p>
<p>First, we have received quite a lot of requests from professors or students interested in teaching open source in academia through Wikimedia projects. We get asked how to assess projects and incorporate them into semester-long coursework. We’ve always wondered how to help them best.</p>
<p>In the past, we have partnered directly with university faculty to help shape projects for their students, which are both educational for them and beneficial for us. For example, last spring we worked with graduate students and faculty in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Technical_Document_Re-working_Group/Technical_Communication_Outreach_and_Events#Technical_Communication_Collaboration,_Spring_2018:_BSU_&amp;_Cloud_Services_Technical_Documentation_Audit_and_Recommendations">Boise State University’s Technical Writing program to audit and evaluate technical documentation for our Cloud Services team.</a>  The students were able to advise a real world client (our team), and we used their valuable recommendations to inform our approach. We would love to be able to provide focused support like this to everyone who asks. We are often able to  provide a <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T169709">project showcase and developer support</a> help, but we find we also have to defer many requests.</p>
<p>Second, in our <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers/Quarterly#Summary_of_key_findings">year-long research study with 61 new developers to Wikimedia projects</a>, we learned that most new developers who we attract are working professionals. However, students get onboarded through our targeted outreach efforts via mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Google Code-in and mentoring programs at hackathons.</p>
<p>On the whole, this also ties into our <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T199001">bigger goal of collaborating with other FOSS communities</a> for engaging technical contributors.</p>
<p>This collaboration with both the initiatives in its initial state is quite straight-forward and not quite resource intensive! We&#8217;ve proposed five <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Developers">newcomer-friendly projects</a> to be listed in the OSSN&#8217;s directory of projects: <a href="https://projects.ossn.club/">https://projects.ossn.club/</a>. The project and mentor names are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES">ORES</a>, Aaron Halfaker</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Newsletter">Extension:Newsletter</a>, Tony Thomas</li>
<li><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Huggle">Huggle</a>, Petr Bena</li>
<li><a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/">WikiEdu Dashboard</a>, Sage Ross</li>
<li><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kiwix">Kiwix</a>, Emmanuel Engelhart and Stephane Coillet-Matillon</li>
</ul>
<p>“Joining forces with Wikimedia for findings more effective ways to support University students while they are trying to contribute code to Open Source Projects is exciting! Students are looking to contribute to projects that are simple, diverse and have an impact; which is precisely what Wikimedia projects offer. I appreciate the time effort the project maintainers are putting aside for onboarding and supporting new contributors and looking forward to working with them.” &#8211; <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/bacharakis/">Christos Bacharakis</a>, Mozilla Open Source Student Network &#8211; Program Manager</p>
<p>For POSSE, we are now <a href="http://foss2serve.org/index.php/HFOSS_Projects#Education">listed</a> as an organization in their directory of HFOSS projects under the Education category. The link contains getting started instructions. When we are approached by students and professors, we are willing to offer help!</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have the Wikimedia Foundation working with TOS to engage students in Wikimedia projects,&#8221; said <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/user/hislop/">Gregory Hislop</a> of the TOS Coordinating Committee. &#8220;Today’s students have grown up using Wikipedia, and they are quite interested in learning about the technology and community behind the project. The educational goals of Wikimedia also provide an excellent introduction to computing for social good. We appreciate the Wikimedia Foundation’s leadership in providing opportunities for students.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this collaboration, we are hoping to engage more university students in contributing to open source projects and support professors in their efforts of teaching open source through Wikimedia projects. We are looking forward to learning from the research findings that Mozilla will conduct post completion of the first pilot, which we could then leverage to improve some of our processes and workflows of supporting new developers. We would also be curious how professors use our projects to teach in a classroom setting, which we could then be shared with our collaborators in academia.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-11T08:00:58.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Justin W. Flory</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the first rites of passage when working on a new project is creating your development environment. It always seems simple, but sometimes there are bumps along the way. The first activity I did to begin contributing to ListenBrainz was create my development environment. I wasn&#8217;t successful with the documentation in the README, so I had to play around and work with the project before I was even running it.</p>
<p>The first part of this post details how to set up your own development environment. Then, the second half talks about the solution I came up with and my first contribution back to the project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6920"></span></p>
<h2>Install dependencies: Docker</h2>
<p>This tutorial assumes you are using a Linux distribution. If you&#8217;re using a different operating system, install the necessary dependencies or packages with your preferred method.</p>
<p>ListenBrainz ships in Docker containers, which helps create your development environment and later deploy the application. Therefore, to work on the project, you need to install Docker and use containers for building the project. Containers save you from installing all of this on your own workstation!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m using Fedora, I run this command.</p>
<pre>sudo dnf install docker docker-compose</pre>
<h2>Register a MusicBrainz application</h2>
<p>Next, you need to register your application and get a OAuth token from MusicBrainz. Using the OAuth token lets you sign into your development environment with your MusicBrainz account. Then, you can import your plays from somewhere else.</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz applications page</a>. There, look for the option to <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register your application</a>. Fill out the form with these three options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: (any name you want and will recognize, I used <code>listenbrainz-server-devel</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>Web Application</code></li>
<li><strong>Callback URL</strong>: <code><a href="http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post</a></code></li>
</ul>
<p>After entering this information, you&#8217;ll have a OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret. You&#8217;ll use these for configuring ListenBrainz.</p>
<h4>Update config.py</h4>
<p>With your new client ID and secret, update the ListenBrainz configuration file. If this is your first time configuring ListenBrainz, copy the sample to a live configuration.</p>
<pre>cp listenbrainz/config.py.sample listenbrainz/config.py</pre>
<p>Next, open the file with your favorite text editor and look for this section.</p>
<pre># MusicBrainz OAuth
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID"
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET"</pre>
<p>Update the strings with your client ID and secret. After doing this, your ListenBrainz development environment is able to authenticate and log in from your MusicBrainz login.</p>
<h2>Initialize ListenBrainz databases</h2>
<p>Your development environment needs some databases present to work. Before proceeding, run these three commands to initialize the databases.</p>
<pre>docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_msb_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_influx</pre>
<p>Your development environment is now ready. Now, let&#8217;s actually see ListenBrainz load locally!</p>
<h2>Run the magic script</h2>
<p>Once you have done this, run the <code>develop.sh</code> script in the root of the repository. Using <code>docker-compose</code>, the script creates multiple Docker containers for the different services and parts of the ListenBrainz server. Running this script will start Redis, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and web server containers, to name a few. But this also makes it easy to stop them all later.</p>
<pre>./develop.sh</pre>
<p>You will see the containers build and eventually run. Leave the script running to see your development environment. Later, you can shut it down by pressing <code>CTRL^C</code>. Once everything is running, visit your new site from your browser!</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost/</a></p>
<p>Now, you are all set to begin making changes and testing them in your development environment!</p>
<h2>Making my first pull request</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, my first attempt at a development environment was unsuccessful. My system kept denying permission to the processes in the containers. After looking at system audit logs and running a temporary <code>setenforce 0</code>, I tried the script one more time. Everything suddenly worked! So the issue was mostly with SELinux.</p>
<p>With my goal to get my environment set up, I figured out a few issues with the configuration offered by the project developers. I eventually made <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR #257</a> against <code>listenbrainz-server</code> with my improvements.</p>
<h4>Labeling SELinux volume mounts</h4>
<p>To diagnose the issue, I started with a quick search and found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24288616/permission-denied-on-accessing-host-directory-in-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow question</a> with my same problem. There, the question was about Docker containers and denied permissions in the container. The answers explained it was an SELinux error and the context for the containers was not set. However, temporarily changing context for a directory didn&#8217;t seem too effective and doesn&#8217;t persist across reboots.</p>
<p>Continuing the search, I found an issue filed against <code>docker-compose</code> about the <code>:z</code> and <code>:Z</code> flags for volume mounts. These flags set SELinux context for containers, with the best explanation I found coming from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35222815/2497452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two suffixes :z or :Z can be added to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The &#8216;z&#8217; option tells Docker that the volume content will be shared between containers. Docker will label the content with a shared content label. Shared volumes labels allow all containers to read/write content. The &#8216;Z&#8217; option tells Docker to label the content with a private unshared label.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I added the <code>:z</code> flag to all the volume mounts in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. I submitted a fix upstream for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listenbrainz-server#257</a>!</p>
<h4>Correct the startup port</h4>
<p>In the README, it says the server will start on port 8000, but the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file actually started the server on port 80. I included a fix for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my pull request</a> as well.</p>
<h2>git push!</h2>
<p>This post makes a debugging experience that actually took hours look like it happened in minutes. But after getting over this hurdle, it was awesome to finally see ListenBrainz running locally on my workstation. It was an even better feeling when I could take my improvements and send them back in a pull request to ListenBrainz. Hopefully this will make it easier for others to create their own development environments and start hacking!</p>

<p><strong>About DIAL</strong></p>
<p>The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) aims to realize a more inclusive digital society in emerging markets, in which all women, men and children benefit from life-enhancing, mobile-based digital services. A partnership among USAID, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Swedish Government and the United Nations Foundation, DIAL’s efforts help accelerate the collective efforts of government, industry and development organizations to realize this vision. In 2016, the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) was named steward of the Principles for Digital Development (also known as the Digital Principles) and is charged with facilitating dialogue among the digital development community, curating the exchange of new ideas and resources, and promoting adoption and new endorsement of the Digital Principles. <a href="http://www.digitalimpactalliance.org">www.digitalimpactalliance.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About the Principles for Digital Development</strong></p>
<p>A Principles for Digital Development Working Group launched in June 2014 to gather insights and feedback from development implementers and donor representatives on using digital technology for their programs. The Working Group was intended to enable those practitioners most likely to be impacted by, and directly influence, the implementation of digital development to interpret and define the Digital Principles. Over the course of a year, the Working Group met nine times to discuss each Principle in-depth, resulting in a shared understanding of what the Digital Principles mean in practice. More information on the Digital Principles can be found at <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org">https://digitalprinciples.org</a>.</p>

        <p class="article-date">NEW YORK, NY &#8211; Partners call on countries to take whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technologies.</p>
<p class="article-date">The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released a global call to action today, inviting governments, donors, technology vendors and other stakeholders to adopt a whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technology. The call to action builds upon a new Digital Investment Framework that DIAL and ITU have developed for global stakeholders which identifies digital technologies that are most important to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The launch of this new SDG Digital Investment Framework is the first step in DIAL and ITU’s ongoing collaboration. The Framework examined use cases in agriculture, education and the health sector and identifies a set of common, reusable ICT building blocks. For example, a few of the building blocks relate to identification, messaging and payment systems, all which can be reused across multiple development sectors. Investing in reusable ICT building blocks – like India and Estonia have approached their e-governance efforts – has been proven to increase efficiency, deliver a higher ROI for governments and create a platform-based ecosystem that attracts a higher volume of application providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“The Framework reinforces our commitment to breaking down barriers and looking for ways to institutionalize digital technology into development services,” said Kate Wilson, CEO, Digital Impact Alliance. “While this is our first joint initiative with ITU, we look forward to our continued work to help governments, the private sector, and donors make smarter and more strategic investments in digital technology to realize their potential to deliver SDG services to anyone, anywhere, at any time.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DIAL and ITU are inviting the development community to support a whole-of-government approach to deploying integrated digital services to achieve the SDGs. Whole-of-government refers to an approach whereby governments look across all sectors and organizations when considering how to invest in ICT infrastructure in an integrated and coordinated manner. Taking this holistic view helps countries realize economies of scale that are not possible when ICT is implemented in a piecemeal fashion. DIAL and ITU have proposed specific calls to action for governments, donors and technology implementers to use this approach and in return have outlined specific support the partners will provide to others.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Information and communication technologies are a key platform for development and a powerful tool to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, says Brahima Sanou, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau. “This Framework is an important tool to help policy makers and donors to identify and direct funds to more efficient and effective ICT investments that will ensure no one is left behind.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SDG commitments made by 193 countries were set to “transform our world” by 2030. Countries’ ability to achieve this goal is dependent on innovative uses of ICT services that can make existing programs more effective and scalable to better serve their population.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Despite billions of dollars invested over the last decade to integrate programs and digital technology, the development community has yet to see software providers creating applications to support the SDGs because investments are often siloed by sector, address a very small target audience and are designed for the short term,” said Jonathan Payne, Senior Policy Advisor at DIAL. &#8220;The SDG Digital Investment Framework and whole-of-government approach address these issues by fostering reusable ICT building blocks that can be implemented across multiple sectors to meet diverse development needs.”</p>

        <p>At the end of the last version I was getting into the groove—and feeling determined.<br />
I had managed to vittle down the instrument backlog to half! I though surely I could do even better! Let&#8217;s start digging into the meat of things and, get serious.</p>
<p>Now we were going to do things seriously, so therefore this was a pretty big version!<br />
It&#8217;s called:</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s get serious!</h3>
<p>I started by looking into a few issues during autumn:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/INST-517">INST-517</a>] &#8211; double bass relations</li>

<p>However right in the middle of this version came <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/"><abbr title="Google Code‐in">GCI</abbr></a>!<br />
I was part of the contest as a mentor this year (for the first time) so naturally I had some instrument tasks ready for our participants. They were pretty popular, with a lot of tickets being added or improved by the participants. So, this is how serious we got for GCI:</p>

<p>The majority of these where done during autumn &#8217;17 and the first half of &#8217;18. The whole thing would have been finished in the summer, hadn&#8217;t May, June and July &#8217;18 been <a href="https://www.yr.no/artikkel/_-fleire-stadar-vil-nok-fa-34-grader_-1.14140919">the hottest summer</a> <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/record-breaking-heat-hits-norway-finland-and-sweden-20180718-p4zs3x.html">ever</a>! I just couldn&#8217;t think, so I took a break until August and then I finished dealing with the last few stragglers.</p>
<p>This version ended up including 58 tickets: the largest to date!<br />
What happens now? Well, at the end of the &#8220;Let&#8217;s get serious&#8221; version I noticed some issues with families and the like, but that&#8217;s a topic for the next blog post!</p>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;d been almost 2 years since I started, and I&#8217;ve managed to get quite a lot done! Here is a graph that illustrates the progress (notice the the jump in added tickets during GCI period, when the participants actually added them faster than I could close them!):<br />

      <div class="content">
        <p>To celebrate today’s International Day of Peace, Zach Tilton, evaluation specialist for the Digital Impact Alliance, reflects on his time working in peacetech and his career journey to leverage technology for peace and development.</p>
<p>As a young child, I remember sitting on my dad’s lap watching the green and black interface of the MS-DOS screen start up, hearing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvr9AMWEU-c">dial-up modem handshake</a> cacophonies as my mom logged on to the internet, and intercepting secret love-note faxes between my sister and her boyfriend. My father was an IT worker, my mother a technology specialist, and my older sister has since dumped the fax (and boyfriend) and now works in Big Tech. While technology runs in my family and has impacted my life beyond fond memories, this past summer I joined another digitally-literate family, the <a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/">Digital Impact Alliance</a>, to help tech have a lasting impact on the lives of others. This post highlights how my experiences with digital development and peacetech underscore why I believe in DIAL’s mission.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth in digital development in 2011, when I helped build and manage an online course for advanced mediation skills during my <a href="https://davidomckaycenter.com/#mckay-center">undergraduate peacebuilding program</a>. During a mediation role-play with some students based in Fiji, who had experienced two coups d&#8217;état in the previous decade, I was struck by the role technology was playing in delivering critical services to underserved populations. Years later as <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/morocco/">Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco</a>, I led an monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) task force to utilize higher rates of mobile devices in the field (85 percent from 57 percent in the previous cohort) to test mobile data collection methods and hold program-wide conversations about improving cultures of accountability and learning.</p>
<p>I eventually connected with <a href="https://howtobuildup.org/">Build Up</a>, a social enterprise that convenes peacebuilders, technologists, and artists, and works on <a href="https://www.stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.cv/">peacetech</a> related initiatives. Aside from volunteering and presenting at their annual <a href="https://howtobuildpeace.org/">Build Peace </a>conferences over the years, I recently worked on two peacetech projects: a <a href="https://peacehack.io/2017/09/12/peacehackldn2017-robotsforpeace/">#peacehack</a> where participants built Twitter bots to amplify the message of International Peace Day and a <a href="https://medium.com/@howtobuildup/building-the-commons-dc60e6ee7b69">campaign</a> following the 2016 US presidential election that utilized Twitter bots and social network analysis to address political polarization, burst filter bubbles, and bring people together for virtual dialogue about polarizing issues.</p>
<p>Throughout all these experiences, despite the number of bots, mobile devices, or automated learning modules, I found technology and program designs were only as good as the people and values behind them. As it turns out, there is evidence to back this up. My love-letter-faxing sister, <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/">Jennifer Brook</a>, is still using tech to make connections, just as a Design Researcher for Dropbox. I recently read one of her <a href="https://content.yudu.com/web/16f77/0A432f8/SchoolOfLife2017/html/index.html?page=80&amp;origin=reader">reports</a> where her research team uncovered a key characteristic of successful, tech-enabled teams is an explicit <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/work/prototyping-peace">social contract</a>, or an articulation of what values inform their approach and how they work together.</p>
<p>Incidentally, DIAL is one of the biggest proponents of social contracts in the digital development space. As steward of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org">Principles for Digital Development</a>, DIAL advocates for ecosystem actors to recognize, commit to, and become <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/">signatories</a> of generally accepted standards of technology for development. Internally, DIAL not only practices the Digital Principles, but has developed an organizational social contract, what we call our Values Agreement, to inform and evaluate our work. From business operations meetings, decisions about future investments, strategy discussions, design and work planning, even down to program-specific monitoring, evaluation, and learning plans, DIAL team-members strive to highlight and work by the values we’ve articulated and signed onto.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16807 size-full" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="1908" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg 4032w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a>These conversations are not always easy, but having an explicit values agreement gives us a north-star to guide us though this challenging work. In an era of unintended consequences in official development assistance, social contracts like the Digital Principles and internal value agreements help DIAL and other ecosystem partners ethically and intentionally realize the vision of a world in which the underserved benefit from digital technology.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello,<br />
I am Chhavi. I have mostly been helping around with all things design in MetaBrainz. I recently graduated from IIT Guwahati, India and started contributing to MusicBrainz after attending the summit last year, around the same time.</p>
<p>As a Google Summer of Code student, my project was to <a href="https://community.metabrainz.org/t/gsoc-2018-react-based-ui-component-library/364623">build a design system</a> with React UI components for the upcoming overhaul of MusicBrainz&#8217;s website. It surely was a really interesting journey, right from when I heard about the community and I would like to share some snippets of it with you!</p>
<p><strong>May 2017:</strong> I hear about Picard, and how a bunch of really cool people who meet online are building it. I was intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>Around August 2017:</strong> I pop in the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">IRC channel</a> #metabrainz, and after much overthinking, I drop a &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Followed was a really warm welcome by people I will soon call friends and a lot of developer-y jargon I had no clue about.</p>
<p><strong>September 2017:</strong> I attend the annual <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/11/03/metabrainz-summit-17/">MusicBrainz developer summit</a> in Barcelona. And boy oh boy, I am now part of the family. Over the few days there, I have immense fun interacting and learning from the community.</p>
<p><strong>November 2017:</strong> We set up our <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&amp;view=detail&amp;selectedIssue=MBS-9652">JIRA ticket system</a> for design issues and start working on the mockups for the redesign. The entire community comes together on JIRA tickets and Discourse posts to talk about where we want to go with this overhaul.</p>
<p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Community members encourage me to try my hand at front-end development. One is really lucky to find people, who encourage you to grow out of your comfort zone and help you cross that wall. In MetaBrainz, there is no shortage of such kind of people.</p>
<p><strong>March 2018:</strong> With little confidence and lots of hopes, I apply for the Google Summer of Code programme. I start learning the ropes of development, with help of online tutorials and obviously our community. We also met for a <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/03/26/delhi-mini-summit-2018/">mini-summit in Delhi</a> to discuss ListenBrainz and spicy food.</p>
<p><strong>April 2018:</strong> Hence began my full-fledged journey of learning and spending a summer of coding. It wasn&#8217;t easy, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p>We set up the initial design system using react-bootstrap and react-storybook. I then started importing UI components into the system, followed by its documentation. I wrote up a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chhavijustme/8feddbe5016365e2d6757a3605607fb9">more detailed description of the process</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>August 2018:</strong> As of now, we have the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/design-system">design system</a> in place. The future plan is to continue adding components to it as well focus on having well thought contributing guidelines. I will also continue working on designing the mockups for the user interface for various entities.</p>
<p>Google Summer of Code was just another milestone in my journey with MetaBrainz. My time here has been a time of both personal and professional growth. I now feel more comfortable in a development environment, the ongoing chats on IRC make more sense to me and I feel less inhibited to put my thoughts out there. I completed my college, moved cities, traveled… all while having a set of these amazing people I call family.</p>
<p>A special shout out to Rob for keeping me going, bitmap for being ever so patient and understanding, samj1912 for introducing me to MetaBrainz, CatQuest, iliekcomputers, Suyash, Freso, reo and zas for being amazing friends through it all.</p>
<p>The thing I like about our community is, we had seasoned developers as well as newbies like me, all together working together to create amazing stuff. Hoping to continue being an involved and colorful part of this community,</p>
<p>You will obviously keep hearing from me in the coming days,<br />
Chhavi</p>

        <p>Many moons ago people clamoured for a way for them to use MusicBrainz via their old FreeDB (and others) enabled players. The hope was that this would be a short term solution as more players picked up MusicBrainz support so we created the FreeDB gateway that allowed old clients to use an ancient interface to look up CDs with MusicBrainz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2007/06/25/freedb-musicbrainz-gateway-now-available/">maintaining this gateway for over 11 years now</a> and recently we had a user asking questions about their new music player and that they were having a hard time getting it to work with our FreeDB gateway.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Someone is developing specifically for a stop-gap measure? Clearly the goal of FreeDB gateway has been misconceived and people are not treating it as a gateway to using the proper MusicBrainz API endpoints.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re no longer keen on supporting this gateway and have been having trouble finding volunteers to maintain it. Our internal staff has enough to do with our own duties and have no interest in further maintaining this and neither do I.</p>
<p>For these reasons the FreeDB gateway is going away in 6 months time; March 18 will be the absolute last day that the gateway will be functioning. Should something crash and the gateway experience problems before then, we&#8217;ll just kill the VM that the gateway is running on and call it a day.</p>
<p>11 years of temporary is enough &#8212; if you use this service, migrate to a proper MusicBrainz endpoint <strong>right now</strong>!</p>

<p>The original post was featured on GSMA Conference Confidential and can be found <a href="http://cc.gsma.com/digital-inclusion-the-role-of-the-mobile-network-operator-in-africa/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Mobile 360 Africa series brings together leaders from Africa’s technology and telecom industries for one of Africa’s largest gathering of technology practitioners. Mobile network operators, donors, development partners, technology companies and startups all convene to engage in thought provoking conversations and showcase innovations that can take Africa to the next level of technology advancement.</p>
<p>The recent Mobile 360 Africa series was held in the land of a thousand hills: Rwanda. Hosted at the Kigali Convention Centre, I had the privilege of having a one-on-one fireside chat with Phillip Amoateng, the phenomenal advocate for mobile internet skills in Airtel CEO for Rwanda.</p>
<p>The fireside chat, <strong>‘Digital Inclusion: The role of the operator in Africa,’</strong> took place during the session <strong>‘Is the Digital Landscape Inclusive for All.’</strong> In this increasingly connected and digital world, consumers are using a wide range of mobile-enabled services for education, agriculture, health, finance and utilities. But despite significant growth in mobile usage across developed regions, in low- and middle-income countries, certain segments of society are being left behind: women, individuals with less education, rural residents, and the poor account for a disproportionate number of those not connected.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have seen increased investments in infrastructure and growth of mobile subscriptions. But it’s not just infrastructure that needs continued investments – users still exhibit limited user capabilities, with most adults in low- and middle-income countries not having basic digital skills and competences. Across Africa, seven in ten people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it. Even in Europe, 19 percent of adults lack the literacy skills, and 45 percent lack the basic digital skills, needed to function fully in a modern society. Interestingly, women are 1.6 times more likely than men to report lack of digital skills as a factor limiting their use of the internet.</p>
<p>Thus, it was interesting to learn from Phillip about the strides that Airtel Rwanda has taken in enhancing mobile internet skills training in a quest to enhance the ability of users to use basic internet applications, understand internet bundles and how to check balances.</p>
<p>On the Mobile Internet Skills Training pilot that Airtel conducted in Rwanda, which reached a quarter of a million subscribers with 300 agents, Phillip said it was encouraging to see first-time internet users discover the value of internet based applications. Tigo sales agents were trained by Airtel/Tigo staff, who then in turn, trained customers that visited their shops.</p>
<p><strong><em>“We learned that customers once taught, would create a ripple effect by training other community embers within their circle.”</em></strong></p>
<p>And the benefit of creating a learning environment is transformative.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Being internet literate is not just about being online but also being available for opportunities. Apart from being in constant contact with friends and families there are also economic benefits and opportunities such as new and better jobs. We highlight the value of the internet as a means of enhancing opportunities for jobs, learning, and business, and more.”</em></strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the roles MNOs can play in addressing challenges of affordability and digital skills training. MNOs can leverage partnerships with education institutions and non-formal education structures to enhance mobile internet skills training. With increasing smart phone penetration, apps will make learning internet skills easier.</p>
<p>As I left the Better Future Stage having had such an insightful conversation with Phillip, I wondered what would happen if all mobile network operators integrated mobile internet skills training for mobile users, particularly those within the low literacy bracket. The number of digitally illiterate Africans would drastically reduce and create more opportunities for communication, learning, jobs and businesses. The future of mobile internet is vast and it’s up to us to make sure everyone is included in its benefits.</p>

        <p>My journey from Python to Golang via Node.js</p><p>Ever since college, I dabbled with Python, made a few scripts here and there, built some websites with Flask and Django. It was the first language I referred to anyone because it was quite easy to start with and delivers amazing results to the developers in no time. Although it was quite a break from having to program in C and Java, the language felt lacking in some of the most important areas.</p><h3>The deal breaker</h3><p>Now came Node.js into my life and I began experimenting with concurrency patterns. Backend JavaScript? Who would take that seriously? At best, it seemed like a new attempt to make server-side development easier at the cost of performance, scalability, etc. Maybe it’s just my ingrained developer skepticism, but there’s always been that alarm that goes off in my brain when I read about something being fast and easy and production-level.</p><p>Node.js became my go to language for a very long time. I got used to the latest programming syntaxes with using ES7 in the client side of things. The single threaded node event-loop made miracles possible for me, without severing any kind of performance and being cheap to use. As time passed, I began a deeper dive into the world of npm modules and the architecture of Node.js. It is a magical space filled with unicorns and rainbows.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*In5xU4obN2qlDEMAyPwg_w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Performance at it’s best?</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers have heard about Node’s non-blocking I/O model; it’s great because it means all requests are handled asynchronously without blocking execution, or incurring any overhead (like with threads and processes) and as the developer you can be blissfully unaware what’s happening in the backend. However, it’s always important to keep in mind that Node is single-threaded which means none of your code runs in parallel. I/O may not block the server but your code certainly does. If you call sleep for 5 seconds, your server will be unresponsive during that time. But my actual problem came with JavaScript. I know most of you will feel this like a rant and there are ways to solve this problem. Please, just bear with me through this.</p><p>When people were developing JavaScript, they wanted it to do all sorts of things and serve every other purpose. It all started with those thoughts, which made it kind of messy. Determining boolean outcomes in plain old JavaScript is hard.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TdKBZcFORJk1sMuKmELNTw.jpeg" /><figcaption>True? False? Confused all in all.</figcaption></figure><pre>// all true</pre><pre>1 == '1';<br />1 == [1];<br />'1' == [1];</pre><pre>// all false</pre><pre>1 === '1';<br />1 === [1];<br />'1' === [1];</pre><p>The internal type system of JavaScript is a mixed bag with six different types which causes all sorts of havoc to the end user.</p><ul><li>Undefined (a variable with no defined value)</li><li>Null (a single null value)</li><li>Boolean (true or false)</li><li>Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!)</li><li>String (textual data)</li><li>Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)</li></ul><p>I know there are ways to sort out these issues effectively, but a language experiencing these sorts of mutability can be problematic to users who are new to JavaScript world.</p><p>Then comes callback hell and having to deal with Promises and all in all the new keywords async and await . I always had retrospection over my language choices and it became very clear that I need strong typing and I can’t live without it. I tried TypeScript but it seemed a bit too expressive to start with.</p><h3>The Second Deal Breaker</h3><p>My main requirements for a language were speed, reliability, built-in concurrency patterns, a strong type system, garbage collection and lots of tooling. It’s not until recent times that I felt the need for all this stuff. I heard rumours earlier about Google building a new language that is going to change the world. True to the naming, it really brought about some deal breaking changes. Here’s a list of things I like about Go and why you’ll love it too.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L3wZZlN4wBjuF-W1vLfhCw.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>go get -u programmer.life/success</strong></figcaption></figure><h4>Opinionated</h4><p>Yes, it is very opinionated. But, I love the way of doing things in one way. With Golang, to do something, there’s just one way of doing it. The official tooling built around Go ensures that we do follow the one way.</p><h4>Goroutines</h4><p>The first half of Go’s concurrency paradigms. Lightweight, concurrent function execution. You can spawn tons of these if needed and the Go runtime multiplexes them onto the configured number of CPUs/Threads as needed. They start with a super small stack that can grow (and shrink) via dynamic allocation (and freeing). They are as simple as go f(x), where f() is a function.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_c9Ob50Cdmh09wLSzHRKgQ.png" /><figcaption>I am strong. Because my dad wanted me to be.</figcaption></figure><h4>Channels</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/1*H2Qh0oiHP64TkG4-Nnjtng.png" /></figure><p>The other half of Go’s concurrency story. Channels are a typed conduit used to send and receive values. These are used to pass values to and from Goroutines for processing. They are by default unbuffered, meaning synchronous and blocking. They can also be buffered, allowing values to queue up inside of them for processing. Multiple go routines can read/write to them at the same time without having to take locks. Go also has primitives for reading from multiple channels simultaneously via the select statement.</p><h4>Compiled Static Binaries</h4><p>Go compiles your program into a <strong>static binary</strong>. Yep, you heard it right. A <strong>static binary</strong>. This makes deployment really simple. Just copy the binary and it should be good to go. No pip install, no virtualenv, no freaking npm install . All of that is handled at compile time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BES005dHRZzV4WBtA7XV7Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>Binaries defeat all!</figcaption></figure><h4>Cross Compilation</h4><p>This is too good to be true. But it is. Yes. Golang allows cross compilation. Ever wanted to test your program on Windows but you use Linux? No more installing compilation tools and building it again on windows. Simply, use GOOS=windows and you can compile it on a Mac or a Linux machine. It even allows changing the architecture of the platform with GOARCH . There’s a laundry list of available platforms and OSes. You can find the list <a href="https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63">here</a>.</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go is a complied language, but still has a runtime. It handles all of the details of mallocing memory for you, allocating/deallocating space for variables, etc. Memory used by variables lasts as long as the variables are referenced, which is usually the scope of a function. Go has a garbage collector.</p><h4>Pass by Value</h4><p>“For the love of all holy Mary, please don’t bring back pointers.” And, well, yeah, they almost averted the crisis in the case of Golang. Everything is passed by value, but there are pointers. It’s just that the value of a pointer is a memory location, so it acts as pass by reference. This means that, by default, there is no shared state between functions. But, you can pass a pointer if you desire/need it for performance/memory utilization reasons. Go does the right thing by default, but doesn’t shackle you. Oh, and there isn’t any pointer math, so you won’t screw yourself with it. As pointed out on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5196498">HN</a>, you can do pointer math with the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/">“unsafe”</a> package and unsafe.Pointer.</p><h4>Type System</h4><p>Go has structs and interfaces. Go’s structs can have methods <em>associated</em> with them. Structs can be anonymously included in other structs to make the inside struct’s variables/methods available as part of the enclosting struct. Interfaces are sets of method signatures. Structs implement an interface by implementing the methods described by the interface definition. Functions can receive values by interface, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/KfKLiAClQE">so</a>. The compiler checks all of this at compile time.</p><h4>Package System</h4><p>Or lack there of. Since Go compiles everything statically, you don’t have to worry about packages at runtime. But how do you include libraries into your code? Simply by importing them via url, like so: import "github.com/bmizerany/pq". Go’s tooling knows how to look that up and clone the repo. Also works with Mercurial, Bazaar &amp; Subversion. go get it, my boy.</p><h4>Anon. Functions &amp; Closures</h4><p>Go supports anonymous functions that can form closures. These functions can then be passed around and retain the environment under which they were created, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/4rYrqw4l7m">so</a>. This can be super powerful when <a href="https://github.com/freeformz/filechan">combined</a> with channels and go routines.</p><h4>Built in profiling</h4><p>It supports pprof as a part of the standard library. And with a <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">very small bit of work</a>, you can access profiling info via a http interface.</p><h4>Defer</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/340/1*9IyFa5ur0nALjTmnACHkGQ.png" /><figcaption>I love to postpone work, yeah.</figcaption></figure><p>Ever forget to close a file descriptor or free some memory? So have the designers of Go. The reason for this is that you usually have to perform those actions far away from where the resources were opened/allocated. Go solves this problem with the defer statement. Each defer statement pushes a function/expression onto a stack that get’s executed in LIFO order after the enclosing function returns. This makes cleanup really easy, after opened a file, just defer file.Close().</p><h4>Comprehensive Standard Library</h4><p>Go’s <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/">standard library</a> is pretty comprehensive.</p><h4>It’s Fast</h4><p>Go compiles down to native code and it does it fast. Usually in just a few seconds. No matter if you have a million package imports. It does compile in seconds. There’s a rumour that Golang actually came to life over a discussion developers had during a <em>code compilation</em> break.</p><h4>Comprehensive Tooling Out Of The Box</h4><p>Go do a go --help. Some of my favorites: go fmt, go doc, go fix go get go tool pprof&amp; go test.</p><h4>Straight Forward Testing</h4><p>Super <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/testing/">straight foward</a>, no magic. And hell, yeah, it even has a <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">race detector</a> that finds out all your runtime woes even before hitting production.</p><h4>Simple C Interface</h4><p>By using build directives you can integrate with C libraries really <a href="https://gist.github.com/freeformz/4552031">easily</a>.</p><h4>Straight Forward Syntax / Standard Formatting</h4><p>The syntax is pretty simple, C like w/o all the crazy of C. But what’s really nice is go fmt, which re-writes your code into the Go standard format. No more arguments like tabs vs spaces or indentation rules! There’s just one way and you have to stick to it my friend.</p><h3>Golang’s Cons</h3><p>With all of that said, it’s not perfect…</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go’s runtime is not super <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_does_Go_perform_badly_on_benchmark_x">tuned</a> yet. By comparison the JVM has had over 18 years of development history behind it. But, for a 1.0.X runtime &amp; language, Go is pretty damn good.</p><h4>Garbage Collector</h4><p>Go programs can malloc a lot of ram at times, even when the program itself isn’t using much. Most of this shows up as VIRT though, so most linux systems just won’t care.</p><h4>1 CPU by default</h4><p>This is going to change over time, but the runtime will, by default, use only <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_no_multi_CPU">one CPU</a>.</p><p>I can bear with having a few cons. After all nothing is perfect in this world. I can live by knowing that there are a few disadvantages while using a language as long as they don’t affect programming like JavaScript’s falsity or callback hell.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=681a70f3bc79" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79">The Gopher way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>A short story on how things changed.</p><p>2017 was a massive year in my life as a developer. It brought about no small changes both in how I go about writing code as well as how I interact with other developers. The one thing that “<strong>matter</strong><em>ed the</em> <strong>most</strong>” is <strong>collaboration</strong>.<strong> 🙌</strong> It’s not just that open source development demands a greater degree of collaboration, but the acceleration of open source as a movement on all ends during the past few years has actually redefined how software development is done. It became a highly collaborative process with distributed version control systems everywhere. 🌍</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*v5o3JVZVH_74c8gl-k6Pmw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Open source ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>This totally changed the way I write code 💻 . To begin with, it has helped me <em>organise my development workflow</em>. For example, when I want to work on a bug fix or a new feature, I can <strong>branch</strong> off anytime. While <strong>Git</strong> has had an impact on how I personally write code, what has transformed software development into a truly collaborative process has been the rise of code hosting services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which provide tools for implementing a collaboration <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">workflow</a> based on Git, with work isolated into branches, organized into commits and documented with commit messages.</p><p>Google Summer of Code 2017 was the one major thing in my life that totally changed it. 😇 I was initially only hoping to finish up the project to 💰 gain money. Only now do I understand that money is the least of the goodies from GSoC. To start with, it gave me new friends 👬 and connections. That is the huge part of the deal. Being a GSoC alumni, you can dive into any of the GSoC summits taking place everywhere in the world. Although I haven't attended any yet, I’m planning on visiting somewhere next year. I’m so thankful to my mentors for patiently <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/we-all-have-bad-days-f59a334f0641">bearing with me through GSoC</a>. Our interaction during the small period of three months brought about some of the most interesting changes in my life. I was offered a contract as a part time freelancer while still being in college. That moment when you really can pay your bills 🎉 was epic. I worked for almost an year of college and it never felt burdening as some of my friends said it would. 😏</p><p>Then comes Mozilla 🦊 into my life. 20th November 2017, marks the day we applied for Mozilla Open Source Support. We were initially so skeptical about the deal and were not sure how much our project aligns to Mozilla’s 🔐 privacy guidelines. Our product wasn’t much focused on privacy, so we had our doubts. We waited patiently through the first couple of months and then lost our hope gradually. But, miraculously, 😍 they reached out to us after five months with the news that I was awarded with the Mozilla Open Source Support Award 2017. By the time I was aware of the news, our project was halfway done. This really eased things up for me. Although the total period of the project was a whopping 12 months, we finished it up in almost half the time thanks to my enthusiastic mentors.</p><p>I never attended a college placement as I wasn’t keen on doing a full time job and wanted to continue as a freelancer. I also have plans for higher studies, so I didn’t want to pull myself into job woes 😩. Initially, I regretted my decision for not attending on-campus placements soon after I left college. Almost all of my friends were busy starting their new lives at companies. It felt so lonely and disturbing. That was the moment I decided to go full out on the search for a job. With about two years of open source record on my resume, it wasn’t that difficult to gain a job in the world outside of placements. I was contacted by atleast 20 companies in the span of a month and I started making choices. I attended 3 interviews and got selected 💃 in two of them. By the end of the month, I had two opportunities to choose from. Then, came my saviour, ❤️Lasse, one of my mentors from GSoC. He brought to me another opportunity to work with a community of people I’ve already known from GSoC. Imagine how refreshing 😍 it would feel to continue working with people whom you already love to work with. I dished out all other options and went with my mentor. I never had the thought that landing a job would be this effortless, provided you have good connections. And a GSoC really helped me get those good connections. I kind of hoped that “making choices” part would come to my life at some point. But, I never knew that it would be so early in life. (I am still 20 😁)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/666/1*77t4yNKlgeHMN1selgRqlA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Welcome to the Dark Side.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>I hope your journey into open source would be as enriching for you as it has been for me.</blockquote><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f5a1e4f6417d" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/how-open-source-turned-my-life-around-f5a1e4f6417d">How Open Source turned my Life Around.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>By <a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/dial-staff/"><em>Michael Downey</em></a></p>
<p>In the technology field, late Summer and early Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere is the traditional conference season &#8212; a time for colleagues to pause to reconnect with each other, learn about trends and challenges in the industry, and of course, build new relationships and strengthen old ones. For the past 20 years now, one of the biggest of these gatherings of creators and consumers of open source software has been the O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or">OSCON</a>). DIAL&#8217;s Open Source Center team just returned from the event in Portland, Oregon, and once again left informed and refreshed as open source enters its third decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16226 size-medium" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As Director of Community for the DIAL <a href="http://www.osc.dial.community/">Open Source Center</a>, I primarily focus on the power of people to build technology to improve the reach and impact of international development and humanitarian response work, and to bring people in our field together to tackle new problems and find new ways to collaborate. That&#8217;s why the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/">Community Leadership Summit</a>, held each year just before OSCON, was particularly valuable this year. An &#8220;unconference&#8221;, the content of the event is driven by participants. I hosted the &#8220;Beyond Fiscal Sponsors&#8221; session, where experts honed in on the challenges and gaps faced by open source software projects and how organizations like DIAL and our Open Source Center can fill those gaps and amplify the impact of software projects &#8212; not only in the development &amp; humanitarian sectors, but also in all types of open source work.</p>
<p>Two days of tutorials and in-depth workshops followed for the team, on topics from giving better technical presentations, to coaching engineering team members, to technology platforms like Kubernetes, containers, and continuous delivery. Finally, there were two days of keynotes and shorter technical talks, enabling us learn about the work of our open source colleagues around the world as the develop best practices.</p>
<p>Of course, there were many exciting conve<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16228 alignright" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>rsations for our team along the way. David McCann, the Center&#8217;s Director of Technology, sat down with O&#8217;Reilly Media to talk a little bit about the United Nations Foundation, DIAL, and how the Open Source Center is working to turbocharge projects in the international development space. Check out the interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgekpgk2Uc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the weeklong event, the entire team &#8212; including the newest member of our team, Heath Arensen, was able to meet and brainstorm with key players in the tech industry about how we might adapt the lessons they&#8217;ve learned to build more financially sustainable open source software projects with long-lasting impact. We had great discussions sharing success stories and ideas for how to strengthen this invaluable effort to build even more technology capacity and launch more technology careers for women, people in the Global South, and other under-represented groups.</p>
<p>On the final day of the week, I presented a talk about the DIAL Open Source Center, how open source software is being used in critical humanitarian and development world in every part of the world, and how we&#8217;re helping to mitigate some of the risk involved by providing additional resources and services to those projects.</p>
<p>Conferences are major investments of time and energy, but the time spent on forging new relationships and partnerships, as well as teaching others about what we&#8217;ve learned, helps to increase the impact of every bit of work we do the rest of the year. Again this year, we were very grateful for the opportunity to be surrounding by thousands of our colleagues for such a vibrant and busy week.</p>

        <p>When I moved to Vermont, I spent a year working as an AmeriCorps/VISTA volunteer on adult literacy, which was a powerful and eye-opening experience into the world of public health and vulnerable populations. It inspired me to go on to medical school, where I learned some important life skills like how to doze off standing up, deliver babies, and how to take on the honor of holding hands with people as they died. After residency I did a fellowship in sports medicine and developed a practice in that field. I continued to practice medicine part-time in urgent care while I moved on to work full-time in the for-profit health informatics industry.</p>
<p>I found the informatics work fascinating, mostly because of the challenges and failures that persisted across practices and hospitals despite access to significant resources and infrastructure. It was surprising to me how much inefficiency and lack of interoperability there was, and most didn’t seem to know how to leverage technology for the sake of better outcomes. There was confusion among the actors around government standards and expectations, even among the governing bodies themselves. While this was my first exposure to challenges faced when integrating tech, it wouldn’t be my last. It’s frustrating to see the potential of technology not be realized in what otherwise seemed like an optimal health care setting.</p>

<p>While I was practicing medicine, I was also starting a family. It was during this phase of my life when my career path solidified. When I first met my oldest son, he was 8 months old and living in an orphanage in Addis Ababa. I’ve since gotten to know his birth mom and her story about making the decision to relinquish him. While my younger son’s story is unique as he was several years older when we first me and from a different region of Ethiopia, his birth family faced similar life-changing challenges. Through our family and our Ethiopian family’s experiences, I was drawn to better understand how it could be that such loving families had to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.</p>
<p>I began volunteering for an NGO that implements programming in Ethiopia, <a href="https://www.whfc.org/">Wide Horizons For Children</a>, focused on reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and empowering families. Many of their projects, which typically focus on health, education and financial stability, utilize digital technology for implementation. This may be in the form of using cell phones to access assessment tools to support health extension workers or data collection for school feeding programs. With limited funding and capacity, this NGO faced some of the same challenges I saw during my time in the for-profit informatics world. On their own, they can’t address their digital technology challenges in a way that would allow them to scale-up, innovate, leverage work from other sectors and reduce redundancy or achieve sustainability.</p>

While here, I’m working on creating public facing documents on what we’ve been calling the Advanced Market Commitment vaccine research. This encompasses the work DIAL did with PATH that investigated the market-shaping mechanisms that changed the way vaccines were procured. It also includes new thinking from DIAL and the Tableau Foundation on drawing lessons learned that can expand access to digital markets. Stay tuned for the release of the research!

        <h4>That was me until the past week.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P-VQUqX0isRifLoC4M-vEw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Embrace your life. Image credits: Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure><p>It can be frustrating to to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job or lifestyle. I hear about people travelling all time to far flung places, or spending days outside, and the only thing that I can think of is how unfair it is that I’m cooped up in my home, with the only view of outside being the screen in front of me.</p><p>However, as someone like me who likes to make the most of each day, (not just weekends!), there are a few things I do to make even my most mundane Mondays a little brighter, because I’m a big believer that every day should be made ridiculously amazing!</p><h4>Get up an hour earlier.</h4><p>Yes. I know my friends. We all are insomniacs and stay up all night doing all kinds of things. But, do give it a try, an early sleep and early rise can truly fresh up your day a lot. Use the time to take a stroll down to a park or even just the sidewalk, if you don’t live near any park. Frantically running into showers, driving or walking to the office, and sitting at your desk before your body has even had time to adjust to your new day, only worsens your day. Set yourself a tone for the mellower day, instead.</p><h4>Make a to-do list in the morning.</h4><p>Thanks to few of my colleagues, I recently started writing up to-do lists at work. It feels so refreshing at the end of the day seeing all those check marks. To give it a try, I brought the same change to my life, not just work. It just feels too good to be true, that simple things like these really refresh your day. But this trick really does work.</p><h4>Make movement non-negotiable.</h4><p>Halfway through your morning and through the afternoon, I force myself to standup and walk around. (Couldn’t do that earlier, so, I forced my laptop to go to sleep, if I didn’t have a walk in time.) I’m trying to do this as often as possible. This helped me have a break from all the problems at work. Work is just work to get paid. It shouldn’t be haunting your afterlife.</p><h4>At lunch, get away from your computer.</h4><p>Be in the moment. Enjoy whatever the food you are eating. Get outside and have a walk, read a book or just take in the day for whatever amount of time you can spare.</p><h4>Do something different each evening.</h4><p>This helps in keeping you away from boredom. Routine way of life gets you bored easily. Don’t just come home, eat dinner and relax on the couch. We should mix things up, if anything go for a long drive out into the wilderness, have a hike planned, take your pet for a walk or visit a beach, watch some movies (the kind you have never seen before) or just have bonfires in the backyard. Just because it is “an evening in the weekdays” doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it!</p><h4>Don’t go into an eating rut!</h4><p>Have something you really enjoy for each meal. Even if it it’s something cooked at home, have a change of menu everyday. And I tried cooking something on my own, didn’t turn out to be good, but it really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Plan out some fun dinner, which is both fun to make and eat! Once you start experimenting in the kitchen, it is hard to stop and the possibilities are endless!</p><h4>Reminiscing your day before bed.</h4><p>Be thankful for everything that happened during the day. The most important thing of all these things is to practice mindfulness throughout the day. Even on your way to work, which may seem like the most mundane thing ever, take in the weather, the sounds, the sights. At work, notice the people around you, and make the best of whatever your job might be. You’re there, so may as well make the best of it and take pride in your accomplishments. Our world is always changing, every second of every hour, so make sure you witness as much of it as you can.</p><p>Hope this helps at least someone in their life. If these tricks really helped you too, take time to throw in some claps.

I am currently a sophomore in Bilkent University, Ankara. And I am a member of IEEE Bilkent Student Branch where I’ve met Andreu in Mobile Days, March 2016. I have spent a month in Lleida, Liquid Galaxy Labs.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my first internship and I feel very lucky that I could come here from Turkey and learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people. As a foreign student, having a practice outside my country has been an incredible experience both because I discovered significant concepts on computer science and practiced my three-week Spanish that I started learning last summer in Malaga. Here in the labs, there are also workshops and events and people with different ideas come and share their projects, opinions, tools and technologies they use. For instance Lot Amoros, the creator of Dronecoria Project for reforestation, shared his ideas and we, students also shared our opinions about what can be done. This has been a very valuable experience due to the project and meeting Lot Amoros himself. We also had a workshop concerning Google Assistant and AIY Voice Kit with the participation of teenagers. We prepared quizzes and flashcards with Actions on Google to use on Google Home and Google Home Mini.<br /><br /> In this four-week period, I experienced open source with Liquid Galaxy. My colleague Oscar Carrasco, also a visiting student from University La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, was able to adapt the Liquid Galaxy to chromebooks for the project, Liquid Galaxy for Education. Now, a team of four including me is working on the Android tablet application that will be used for Liquid Galaxy for Education.<br /><br /><br /> As a foreign computer science student, my stay in Lleida has widened my world by all means, and I thank Andreu Ibáñez for this experience and his hospitality!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>My experience visiting Lleida<br />Oscar Carrasco</b></span><br />My name is Óscar Carrasco and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). <br /><br />I met Andreu in last July, in his TLP Innova conference about Google Summer of Code which really interested me, so I decided to stay in touch with him. We contacted again in November and, one month later, I collaborated with him as a Liquid Galaxy project mentor in the Google Code-in program.<br /><br />This experience was enjoyable to me, so I travelled to Lleida this summer in order to keep developing Open-source software in a project called “Liquid Galaxy for Education”.<br /><br />The first two things that got my attention in Lleida were the blazing hot weather and the lack of sea. Since I’ve been living near the ocean my entire life, it was suffocating not to see it around me. It was hard for me to get used to the climate.<br /><br />The main activity was working in the labs in the morning. We managed to port most of the core Liquid Galaxy features into the Chromebooks during my stance, as it was intended to happen. My partners were also working on improving the legacy Liquid Galaxy Controller Android application during this time.<br /><br />We were also involved in many other tasks. We went to the cinema, had dinner at Punto Estrella, (popular restaurant in Lleida), participated in a local radio channel called UA1, visited a startup called InTech3D and hosted three Google Developer Group meetups in our spare time. And we did all of this in only five days! I had never felt so productive in my entire life.<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">Deniz left, Oscar right</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">At the end of the summer we'll continue this with histories from the other students, <br />Ivan, Aleks and Albert, from EPS, Lleida.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg" width="640" /></a></div></div>

Liquid Galaxy for Chromebooks installation is 90% developed (with the help of Oscar Carrasco), and Android controller application is on his way.<br /><br />Here we want to offer some task related to the integration of the Google Assistant technology in the Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />- <b>Develop a library to connect the Google Assistant</b>, in his Google home form factor, to the Liquid Galaxy.<br />This will consist on a DialogFlow and a webhook that will connect directly to a master computer on a Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />Initially the functionalities we want to see are two:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the Liquid Galaxy to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; places. IE: "Ok Google, go to Izmir, Turkey", for the LG to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; move to Izmir in Turkey.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the camera. IE: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, move forward" to have the camera moved fwd.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, turn right 90 degrees"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or similar actions to implement all the usual movements a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; visitor to a LG installation will do with a Space Navigator<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; joystick.<br /><br />You can see this in action on this video, from student Marcel Porta, showing up the demo he created in 2017 to launch projects on the Liquid Galaxy from a Google Home.<br /><br /><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltqjQC-jMLs" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />In the near future we also want to develop the Google Assistant functionality in the LGxEDU Android app, for launching and playing with the quizes.

        <p>Deploy to AWS EC2 instances using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>So, recently, I’ve been trying to deploy a private repository from GitLab CI/CD pipelines. I couldn’t find an easy way to deploy docker images to EC2 instances. So, I made a workaround of my own using a crazy simple tool we all know of, the <strong>SSH</strong>.</p><p>Through this tutorial, I’m gonna be assuming that you have a working EC2 instance with sudo access to the shell and you already have a docker-compose file ready to set off to production.</p><h4>Setting up EC2 instance</h4><p>SSH into your instance and install docker and docker-compose on it. There are numerous tutorials available online on how to install them. So, I’m not gonna cover that here.</p><p>Once you’ve got them setup, choose a location to place your docker-compose.yml file. Preferably somewhere in /opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt; . So, now, try deploying the compose file directly using docker-compose up -d . Once you’re sure that works, let’s move on to the next step.</p><p>Generate an SSH RSA private/public key pair, that we’re going to use to login from GitLab CI runner and run the deploy script. To generate the key pair, we’ll use ssh-keygen.</p><pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privkey</pre><p>Now, you should have two files, privkey and privkey.pub in your current working directory. Paste the contents of privkey as is (without extra spaces) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance. Copy the contents of privkey.pub , we’ll be using that later from the gitlab CI.</p><h4>Setting up GitLab CI/CD job</h4><p>I’m gonna show an opinionated GitLab CI configuration file, which we’ll be using to build and deploy the images from master branch of the repository.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p68SyHN3hNK0gkXs7554EA.png" /><figcaption>GitLab CI Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, we use the GitLab CI preferences pane, where we’ll setup a few environment variables listed below.</p><ul><li>DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY: The contents of privkey.pub which we generated earlier.</li><li>DEPLOY_SERVER_IP : The IP address of the EC2 instance.</li><li>DEPLOY_HOST : The username of the EC2 instance, eg. ubuntu , if you use a ubuntu base image for setting up EC2 instance.</li></ul><p>Make sure that you’ve turned on the protected flag in the variables section for each of the variables to set them only on protected branches like master.</p><p>From the GitLab CI configuration file, you can see that there is a script .ci/deploy.sh on the repository which we’ll be using to run for deployments. It can be something like this.</p><pre># .ci/deploy.sh</pre><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash<br />set -x -e -o pipefail</pre><pre>COMPOSE_LOCATION="/opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt;/master"<br />DOCKER_GROUP_NAME="docker"</pre><pre># Early checks<br />which docker<br />which docker-compose<br />id -nG | grep "$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME"</pre><pre># Start deployment<br />cd $COMPOSE_LOCATION<br />docker-compose pull<br />docker-compose up -d</pre><p>That’s it, you’re done setting up CD with GitLab.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e215154730f" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f">Ship it!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Los Chromebooks son generalmente portátiles de potencia media y fácil uso con su sistema operativo Chrome OS, bajo coste de adquisición, mantenimiento y gestión, y que están muy orientados al mercado educativo.<br /><br />El software estará compuesto primero por el core Liquid Galaxy instalado en los Chromeboosk bajo Crouton, un software que permite la instalación de Linux muy fácil y rápidamente, y que será ejecutado a la vez que el Chrome OS. Aparte está definiéndose y desarrollándose una aplicación Android para ser ejecutaba en una tableta de 7 a 10", y que dispondrá de los controles del sistema, así como de una aplicación educativa abierta, que vendrá precargada de material educativo para Geografía e Historia y que permitirá a los profesores expandir los contenidos por ellos mismos.<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white;

        <h2 id="how-it-all-began-">How It All Began ?</h2> <p>I had been contributing to <a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit">scancode-toolkit</a> for quite a while and it took me a few months to get accustomed to the codebase. It was the 12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode (the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour since the past couple of months.</p> <p>I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my aspiration. I found <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)</a> which is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of the road, with my friend to check the result and here’s what it displayed:</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance.png" /> </figure> <p>Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the paramount program.</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance_mail.png" /> </figure> <h2 id="whats-next-">What’s next ?</h2> <p>The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have almost completed upgrading the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class and initiated a few bug fixes. I would like to heartily thank my mentors <a href="https://github.com/pombredanne">@pombredanne</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krysnuvadga">@krysnuvadga</a> for keeping faith in me throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX community. I’m super excited to spend this summer with SPDX and intend to use this blog to post updates and developments.</p>

      <i class="author"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <h2 id="tldr-why-the-title">TLDR; Why the title?</h2> <p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos. Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p> <ul> <li>I know what I can do: <ul> <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li> <li>Write more regularly.</li> <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li> <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li> <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li> <li>Read more books.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t know what I would do: <ul> <li>Do I go for a job after B.tech? <ul> <li>If yes, then do I need to do something differently from what I am currently doing?</li> </ul> </li> <li>or, I should rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? <ul> <li>If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</li> </ul> </li> <li>and moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me? <ul> <li>Is it lethargy? <ul> <li>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my free time doing these things.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I too busy? <ul> <li>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a few friends, I don’t really do much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not put in enough efforts? <ul> <li>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not have enough resources? <ul> <li>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to advice me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I just slow? <ul> <li>Yes, probably.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2> <p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p> <ul> <li>What stream after High School? <ul> <li>Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</li> <li>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences either.</li> <li>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in other people’s calculation.</li> <li>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What college do you want to go to?</p> <p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for B.Tech program - My rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option. I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2> <p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training. But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into consideration.</p> <p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions” wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes, because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the “optimum” choice.</p> <p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure). The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment” then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p> <p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? - What about MS?</p> <p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be selected, am I too late?</p> <h3 id="solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3> <p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p> <ul> <li>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</li> <li>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</li> <li>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long “thought drills”</li> <li>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely find a way to a solution.</li> </ul> <p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>

        <p>During PyCon India, I had the privilege to meet Sanyam (<a href="https://github.com/CuriousLeaner">@CuriousLeaner</a>), whom I already knew as a mentor to many in the #dgplug community, when he visited the coala community space. We had a short discussion about How to nurture Open Source Communities in college? It was then, when @crancg got him to join the slack for AMU-OSS. And then, one wild day we invited Sanyam to come speak at our college and share his insights on OSS and the following event was born.</p> <p><img alt="Group_Photo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15556382/36986480-eacc15be-20bf-11e8-98d0-9ed9c9331f4b.jpg" /></p> <h2 id="what-happened-there">What happened there?</h2> <h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and Open Source Software</h3> <p>The first part of the session consisted of an introduction to the concept of Free and Open Source Software, and was chaired by Sanyam - the students were made aware of the importance of FOSS in the world. He and the other mentors also took questions and cleared the doubts of students regarding the world of open source.</p> <h3 id="how-to-build-an-add-on-for-mozilla">How to build an Add-on for Mozilla?</h3> <p>The second part of the session was a hands-on technical event, and the students were taught how to implement an add-on (extension) for Mozilla Firefox. The importance of extensions for adding functionality to any browser was stressed, and the students were encouraged to build their own add-ons and to get them published.</p> <h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3> <p>The final part of the event involved the mentors explaining how students could contribute to open source, and how the community was always looking to better itself through the contributions of new and young talent. The talk was inspirational and the students in attendance seemed motivated and encouraged to become a part of the development community.</p> <h2 id="vote-of-thanks">Vote of Thanks</h2> <p>First of all, I would like to thank Sanyam, Shashank and Shivam for coming to the event and inspiring students. A huge shoutout to @crancg for having established AMU-OSS. I would also like to express my gratitude towards Mr. Zafaryab Sir, who is always enthusiastic about such initiatives without whom the event would never have been possible.

        <p>Over the past few years I’ve become an avid supporter of FOSS and the open-source community, and it became a goal of mine to start contributing to the open-source world. <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code-In</a> seemed like the perfect opportunity to help me achieve this goal (and much sooner than I thought!), so I signed up without hesitation.</p><p>Once the contest began, I had to choose my first task. I picked a task from <a href="https://coala.io">coala</a> because, well, I thought “coala” was a cute name. coala is a handy tool that can lint and often fix problems in your source code. They have a very helpful guide for newcomers too, making it easy for anyone to get started with contributing.</p><p>My first task was a coding task, but the process of using git and creating tests proved far tougher than writing the main piece of code. I made a lot of mistakes in these areas, and didn’t do things quite the way I should have been doing them, but with some help from my mentors my work was eventually merged, and I had made my first contribution. Success!</p><p>Almost a month later, and I’ve completed an array of different tasks and learnt a ton of new stuff. School, exams and other priorities meant I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I would have liked to Code-In, but I made sure to attempt a variety of different tasks in different areas. Naturally, I encountered difficulties on almost every task — there was a lot of time spent meticulously reading through source code in an attempt to understand things, and I lost count of the number of times I had to ask for extensions. These difficulties are of course key to improving and amongst other things, I’ve finally got the hang of git, I’ve dabbled with graphics and regex for the first time, and (after several run-ins with coala’s linting bears) I’ve learnt to write cleaner and better code.</p><p>But I think the most important things I have learnt come from the experience of working within a real-life organisation. The process I had to go through in order to understand and build upon existing code taught me a lot, and using various tools to complete my tasks has given me valuable practical skills and knowledge that will no doubt be helpful in the future.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful to the mentors at coala for providing very detailed and justified feedback where necessary, answering questions and helping me to resolve any problems. Working with such knowledgeable and friendly people has been extremely rewarding, and I hope to continue contributing to the organisation.</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank Google for making this wonderful experience possible. I’m a little sad that I didn’t find out about GCI sooner as I’ll be too old to participate again next year, but nonetheless, I have had a lot of fun and look forward to diving deeper into the world of OSS!</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba254d19ce28" width="1" />

        <p>Good bye crappy config files!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/945/1*up5_dOjlNdHMTa3Cw-Ku2w.png" /></figure><p>I’m trying out <a href="https://parceljs.org"><strong>Parcel.js</strong></a> for one of my most recent endeavours and I must say I’m quite loving it so far. Well, as you know everyone loves <a href="http://webpack.js.org"><strong>webpack</strong></a> and <a href="https://brunch.io"><strong>brunch</strong></a>. But, this baby 👶 gives a rock solid support for simple things whenever you want it.</p><p>I gotta admit, the zero-config stuff is really enticing. Especially, when you’re just getting started with JavaScript and web development in general. It has built in asset packaging and hot module reloading.</p><p>But, it really is only as powerful as the config-less aproach is. For medium and large scale projects, as everyone would speak out, going for brunch or webpack is the better idea.</p><pre>$ yarn global add parcel-bundler</pre><p>However, getting started with parceljs is as simple as installing parceljs bundler and writing an index page with some javascript.</p><pre>index.html</pre><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br /> &lt;script src="./index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><pre>index.js</pre><pre>console.log('Welcome to parcel.js');</pre><p>Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports <a href="https://parceljs.org/hmr.html">hot module replacement</a> for fast development. Just point it at your entry file:</p><pre>parcel index.html</pre><p>Now open <a href="http://localhost:1234/">http://localhost:1234/</a> in your browser. You can also override the default port with the -p &lt;port number&gt; option.</p><p>Use the development server when you don’t have your own server, or your app is entirely client rendered. If you do have your own server, you can run Parcel in watch mode instead. This still automatically rebuilds as files change and supports hot module replacement, but doesn't start a web server.</p><pre>parcel watch index.html</pre><p>When you’re ready to build for production, the build mode turns off watching and only builds once. See the <a href="https://parceljs.org/production.html">Production</a> 🚀 section for more details.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4958afe5ba3e" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/boilerplates-are-fun-right-4958afe5ba3e">Boilerplates are fun, right?!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>So sometime ago i added a foreign key column as a rails migration which creates an index on that column as well: through the <code>add_foreign_key</code> method. This index is of the form <code>rails_fk_some_hex</code> Unfortunately i forgot to add a unique constraint with the index which was a necessary use case.</p> <p>I thought ‘no big deal’ i’ll just add that now, i ran:</p> <pre>add_index :table_name, :column_name, unique: true, index_name: :some_name</pre> <p>and viola it worked on my local machine like a charm. It even removed the previous index on that column that the foreign key migration created.</p> <p>but running this on staging. I had 2 indexes, 1 unique and 1 non unique -_- .</p> <p><strong>Little debugging and i could confirm a pattern</strong>:</p> <p>If these 2 migrations occur in the same <code>rails db:migrate</code> then the <code>add_index</code> migration also overwrites the index created by the <code>foreign_key</code> migration. However in different migrations, it just adds another index.</p> <p><b>Solution</b>:</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is a feature or a bug. To solve for the cases where migrations run together(dev machines) or on servers where they are run separately I used <code>remove_index</code> if <code>index_exists?</code> .</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>This isn’t something “breaking or a huge discovery”, just something weird i found in my Rails Journey and something you should be aware about.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><br /> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com&amp;blog=108096159&amp;post=383&amp;subd=learningstuffeveryday&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

        <h1 id="how-to-get-started-with-self-driving-cars">How to get started with self driving cars?</h1> <p>I’ve asked myself (and Google) this question numerous times and have always learned something new in the process which in turn has lead to a superficial learning of autonomous technology — helping me getting a taste of it, but for a deeper knowledge on the subject, I must complete courseware, develop some projects for hands on experience and in the process network with people who have seasoned this art who can help me get a better insight on the current trends in research and industry.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYTE7HBbZokfRhXMDB7VUg.gif" /></p> <h2 id="courseware">COURSEWARE</h2> <p>I’ve completed my home work of figuring out a Coursework for conquering the world of Self Driving Cars:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://rj722.tech/deeplearning.ai">Deep Learning specialisation</a></li> <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a></li> <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344">Intro to parallel Programming</a></li> <li><a href="http://rj722.tech/cs231n.stanford.edu">CS231N</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot">mobile-robot</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0">Underactuated robotics</a></li> <li>https://www.udacity.com/apollo (Yet to start)</li> </ul> <p>I haven’t included the Udacity self driving car Nanodegree program (although, it is a great resource) because it is quite expensive. Every course listed here is either freely available or can be audited free of cost as of January, 2018.</p> <h2 id="projects">PROJECTS:</h2> <p>This is actually the most exciting and important part, as not only do I gain hands on experience on how things work here and the workflow involved, but it also allows me to build a portfolio around automotive technology which, I can then showcase to the potential employers.</p> <p>It is important to take note of the fact that laying down a clear goal of a project before you start it yields better results and agreeably, it’s easy to track progress if you quantify things. For example, if your todo list currently says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be - Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear as possible when posing a project statement.</p> <p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Develop a brain for a self driving car</strong> <ul> <li>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a road scene.</li> <li>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</li> <li>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this neural network.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</strong> <ul> <li>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</li> <li>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a particular road in GTA-5.</li> <li>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A completely self driving RC car</strong> <ul> <li>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</li> <li>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and preferably until battery dies.</li> <li>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</li> <li>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</li> <li>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the curriculum of the various courses.</li> </ul> <h2 id="some-extra-fun-to-dos">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2> <ul> <li>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics</li> <li>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity</li> <li>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</li> <li>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</li> </ul> <p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be! I’ll keep you updated with detailed reports on projects I make.</p>

(Let a contributor be a person that commented on at least two issues which they didn’t open.)</p> <figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="f4c5"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div> <div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" height="50" width="75"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R4S6yIEqW1vNJ-S3Xx4R6Q.png" /></div> </div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Contributor Interest Histogram (Summed over the biggest repositories)</figcaption></figure> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="69d5">This makes clear that for any bigger open source project, “Watching” the repository is resulting in a lot of spam for most of the people. If they don’t respond, notifying them was of no value for the discussion after all.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8d2">We can also observe that only very few project managers care for any significant portion of the issues. Only 6 of our human contributors in total care for more than every 5th issue at all. Here’s our heros:</p> <pre class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p" id="dffd">25.05%: golang/go -&gt; ianlancetaylor, Watching 47.48%: moby/moby -&gt; thaJeztah, Watching 27.31%: moby/moby -&gt; cpuguy83, Watching 36.67%: owncloud/core -&gt; PVince81, Not watching 47.12%: saltstack/salt -&gt; gtmanfred, Watching 25.54%: saltstack/salt -&gt; Ch3LL, Watching</pre> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre" id="d310">However, we do see that 29.1% (117) of all contributors (402) are still subscribed to all notifications of the repository (watching it).</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8105">Switching to Polling</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="aef0">Many contributors switch to polling instead of watching the main repository.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a2e">However, we still see that the main maintainers keep watching the repository: without them, it’s very easy to miss out on new issues and it’s hard to make sure that the right people take a look at the right issues in a decentralized system.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f8d0">Introducing Automation</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3a99">In many communities we see home grown bots arising that apply labels and sometimes assign people based on keywords. This works especially well for automatically created issues (e.g. from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentry</a>) but is not a full solution.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e029">We’ve tried it. Contributors started mentioning keywords consciously and it didn’t really work for user reported issues.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="cb2a">Better Automation!</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a947">We wouldn’t be GitMate if we didn’t strive for more. Our data suggests that people are spending way too much time on their notifications. We’ve maintained <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://coala.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">coala.io</a> in the past and we know that reading through all of them is impossible even for core maintainers. Static keyword based automation doesn’t seem to be enough.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="35b4">Since quite a while we’re hacking on an artificial intelligence that helps you dealing with this problem by analyzing exactly what every person in your team is discussing about on GitHub or GitLab and mentioning the ones who are important for solving any new issue.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf53">GitMate is built as a full automated triaging solution. Right now it already mentions related developers in new issues, finds duplicates, labels issues and closes old issues. It is already used by companies like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://owncloud.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ownCloud</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.kiwi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kiwi.com</a>and we’re looking for more beta testers.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf29">If you like this idea, visit <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gitmate.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitMate.io</a> and shoot us an email to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="mailto:lasse@gitmate.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lasse@gitmate.io</a> :).

We only wanted to look at the biggest ones (measured by scraped file size, i.e. roughly amount of text over all issues communicated). We’ve excluded ‘ZeroK-RTS/CrashReports’ because no humans seem to be operating that repository.

        <p>I’ve always loved programming, and doing it socially on GitHub makes things even better. Although I was already a member of several small organizations, such as <a href="https://github.com/gitpoint">GitPoint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Chaosthebot">ChaosTheBot</a> and my local FIRST Robotics Team, this is my first experience working with a really large organizations — in my case, <a href="https://github.com/coala">coala</a>. It’s an amazing experience, so I’m incredibly grateful to <a href="https://g.co/gci">Google Code-In</a> for the opportunity.</p><p>Working with everyone at coala has been fantastic. Not only have I been introduced to a wonderful and powerful code linter (which I’ve already started to implement into my existing code bases), I’ve also learned a ton about Python, unit tests, coala’s commit guidelines and probably most importantly, how to work in a large-scale team environment.</p><p>In the Google Code-In competition, students claim bite-sized “tasks” that usually involve solving a specific bug or adding a feature to one of their organization’s projects. Before “claiming” a task (committing to work on that specific issue) it’s generally good to research how you might go about it and what kinds of external tools or resources might be able to help you. For example, before I claimed a task involving the generation of an RSS feed for one of coala’s websites, I first found an NPM module that could easily create the feed and then read the documentation thoroughly to make sure I understood the module’s usage. At that point, I felt comfortable enough with the technology to claim the task.</p><p>If you are pushing yourself, eventually, you will run into a problem while solving a task. That’s totally fine. The mentors are there to help you overcome any barriers you may come across. I’ve ran into difficulties and had questions about a task several times, but contacting the coala mentors on Zulip or Gitter was very simple, and, after they get back to me quickly, we always work out a good solution. I’m very fortunate to have a huge team of mentors at coala who are willing to provide loads of feedback for even the smallest change, too. Learning directly from professionals in the programming industry has helped me become a better developer and improve my coding habits and abilities.</p><p>If you’re interested in coala, get involved by solving some newcomer issues. Once you’re comfortable, choose tasks in the coala repositories with a higher difficulty. The difficulty system set up in coala repositories is very helpful when you’re just starting off, as all issues are given a rating from newcomer, to low, to medium, to high, and you can pick and choose the issues with a rating you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Overall, coala has given me a stronger appreciation for all open source software, developers and maintainers while also helping me improve my own programming abilities. I’m very happy to be a member of the team and look forward to continuing to work with them well after this year’s Google Code-In competition is complete. Who knows, maybe in a few years I’ll be able to mentor the next generation of coala developers in their Google Code-In journey, and hopefully help them have just as good of a time as I’ve been having.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=174c83855630" width="1" />
