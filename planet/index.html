        <p>December just started, and this year I want to try to do something a bit similar to advent calendars: make a new release of one of my (too) many projects every weekend! This release month begins with the release of <a href="http://agateau.com/projects/doxyqml">Doxyqml</a> 0.5.0, an input filter to let you document your QML code using Doxygen.</p> <!-- break --> <p>Just like in <a href="http://agateau.com/2018/doxyqml-0-4-0">version 0.4.0</a>, most of the work has been done by other contributors, with me taking care of reviewing the code and improving project infrastructure (improving tests, adding coding style checks...). Here is the list of changes:</p> <ul> <li>Turn internal QML elements into private C++ members, see <a href="https://github.com/agateau/doxyqml">README.md</a> for details on how to use this. (Matthew Lam)</li> <li>Add support for <code>@returns</code>, a synonym for <code>@return</code>. (Max Paperno)</li> <li>Add support for trailing (inline) Doxygen comments for properties, signals, and methods (but not method parameters). (Max Paperno)</li> <li>Fix installation issues on Windows (Max Paperno)</li> <li>Improve test coverage and infrastructure (Aur&#233;lien G&#226;teau)</li> <li>Setup flake8 to enforce coding style (Aur&#233;lien G&#226;teau)</li> </ul> <p>As usual, you can get it using pip:</p> <p><code>pip3 install --upgrade doxyqml</code></p> <p>Or download the <a href="https://github.com/agateau/doxyqml">source code</a>.</p> <p>That's it for this release, see you next weekend for a new release of another project...</p>

      <h5>2018-12-01T11:00:00.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Volker Krause</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It&#8217;s already two month since I last wrote a <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2018/09/29/kde-itinerary-august-september-2018.html">summary on recent developments</a> in KDE Itinerary, so here is what happened in October and November. With the 18.12 application release coming up shortly, that&#8217;s also largely what you can expect in there.</p> <h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3> <p>The probably biggest visible change is the introduction of automatic trip grouping. That is, multiple elements (flights, train reservations, hotel bookings, etc) belonging to the same trip are grouped together in the timeline and can be collapsed for a better overview.</p> <p>This might sound simple (and for a human it is), but finding a reliable way to automatically group things, and to automatically name the resulting trip, is actually quite tricky. Some of the challenges include:</p> <ul> <li>Trips that don&#8217;t return to the starting point. It&#8217;s not uncommon for larger urban areas to have multiple airports that all are viable &#8220;home airports&#8221;. E.g. TXL -&gt; CDG -&gt; SXF should be detected as a trip group, despite technically not being a loop. A distance threshold addresses this to some extend, but would need to be fairly large to also work e.g. for all of London&#8217;s airports.</li> <li>Distinguishing between changeover stops and the actual destinations. This matters for picking good default names for trips. We use hotel bookings as an indication for this, the length of a stay between two location changes might also be interesting to look at. Assuming a trip is symmetric however isn&#8217;t working.</li> <li>Incomplete data. This can be just not yet imported or booked elements of a trip, or elements that simply don&#8217;t exist. The Randa demo data set shows this for example with the unidirectional bus trip from Randa to Zermatt, which is followed by a (missing) hike back. A strict connectivity search would detect that gap and wrongly interrupt the trip there. By also looking for the matching reservation numbers of the enclosing flights we can still make this work.</li> <li>Missing city names. This is again mostly a problem for naming, as cities are often the best level of detail for describing the destination. That is &#8220;Munich&#8221; makes sense while &#8220;Franz Joseph Strauss&#8221; (fallback to airport name) or &#8220;Germany&#8221; (fallback to country name) are sub-optimal, the latter particularly if we started in that country.</li> </ul> <p>As you can imagine this needs a lot of fine tuning to produce useful results, and possibly additional search and naming strategies for cases not yet considered. So this is a good place to help, if you have particularly complex trips or other cases where the current approach could produce better results, or just ideas on how to improve this, please let us know.</p> <p>That&#8217;s not all that is new though, <a href="https://nicolasfella.wordpress.com/">Nicolas</a> started to work on adjusting the screen brightness when getting ticket barcodes scanned on your phone. So far we have Linux/Solid support for Plasma Mobile, Android support is still to come. This makes it less likely that you are the unpopular person to stall the boarding queue ;-)</p> <h3 id="infrastructure-work">Infrastructure Work</h3> <ul> <li>Post-processing of extracted data can now employ <a href="https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber">libphonenumber</a>. Given a partial address e.g. of a hotel or a restaurant, this allows us to determine the country from an international phone number, or the other way around make a local phone number internationally dial-able when we know the country. There is more that libphonenumber can do, such as determining the city or timezone from a given number, that still has to be integrated though.</li> <li>Custom extractors can now also specify filter expressions on proprietary barcode content. This allows us for example to select the SNCF ticket extractor without having the email context for such a PDF document. So far this was only possible on standard barcodes like IATA BCBP or UIC 918.3.</li> <li>A new convenience method for extractor scripts allows to turn the often found Google Maps URLs into JSON-LD geo coordinate objects.</li> </ul> <h3 id="important-fixes">Important Fixes</h3> <ul> <li>We switched to a newer variant of the <a href="https://github.com/nu-book/zxing-cpp">ZXing</a> barcode decoding library. This fixes a few cases of failed detection of PDF417 codes with small module sizes (common in boarding pass PDF files), and as a very welcome side-effect increases performance and fixes a memory leak on failed barcode detections.</li> <li>The airport identification code now considers a few more alternative transliterations of non-ASCII characters. This allows us to properly identify more airports from their (translated) human-readable names and look up information from the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> knowledge database about them.</li> <li>Nicolas implemented generic airline name extraction from Apple Wallet boarding passes.</li> <li>Weather forecast in KDE Itinerary now also works for negative coordinates.</li> </ul> <h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3> <ul> <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">schema.org</code> based value classes got a shared null state optimization, and avoid detaching their internal state when their property setters are called with unchanged values (see separate <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2018/11/10/cxx-auto-generated-comparison-operators.html">post</a> on this). This saves a significant amount of memory allocations during post-processing of extracted data.</li> <li>We reduced the need for expensive image scaling operations in barcode extraction from PDF files and improved the heuristics on which graphics found in a PDF could even be a valid barcode, which combined with the better ZXing variant mentioned above cuts the runtime of the extractor test suite by almost half. PDF extraction performance is important as the KMail plug-in applies this much more aggressively then in the previous release.</li> </ul> <h3 id="ui-improvements">UI Improvements</h3> <ul> <li>Importing and pasting content into KDE Itinerary got streamlined by supporting remote URLs too, and by auto-detecting content. So there&#8217;s only a single workflow for all supported content types now.</li> <li>The timeline model got a vastly improved test system, which enabled us to fix a number of merge fails when importing data, resulting in duplicated or otherwise wrong elements in the timeline.</li> </ul> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute</h3> <p>Again a big thanks to everyone who <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2018/09/01/kde-itinerary-data-extraction.html">donated test data</a>, this helps immensely, please keep it coming!</p> <p>If you want to help in other ways too, see <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/280/">our Phabricator workboard</a> for what&#8217;s on the todo list, for coordinating work and for collecting ideas.

        <p>During the development cycle of 5.12 we&#8217;ve been working on making it easier to use Qt Lite in Yocto builds, especially those using our meta-boot2qt layer.</p> <p>Qt Configuration Tool now has the ability to export the set of selected Qt Lite features into files that can be used by the Yocto build to build a slimmer Qt.</p> <p>Qt Configuration Tool is commercial-only and allows you visually explore and toggle different optional parts of Qt after opening an initially configured source tree. It can be used directly to configure that source tree for builds that don&#8217;t include features that you don&#8217;t need. That configuration can also be exported into a single file that can imported later, which makes sharing the configuration between people easier.</p> <p>Previously there however wasn&#8217;t a clear path to using that in a Yocto-driven build, since meta-qt5 recipes build Qt module by module. New version 1.2 of the tool and the new qt5-features class in meta-boot2qt layer provide that. Both are available in Qt for Device Creation 5.12.</p> <ol> <li>Run <code>./configure</code> for a qt5 source tree with the necessary options for your<br /> platform and choosing the commercial license.</li> <li>Open Qt Configuration Tool and select the build directory from the previous step.</li> <li>Select/unselect the features you want with the tool.</li> <li>When the configuration is ready, select &#8220;File&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Export Features for<br /> Boot2Qt&#8221; and pick a folder.

        <p>So far, so good! We're having quite a variety of students and I'm happy to see new ones still joining. And surprising to me, we're still getting beginner tasks being done, which keep us busy.<br /><br />New this round were some tutorials written by&nbsp;Pranam Lashkari. I hope we can expand on this next year, because I think a lot of students who are willing to do these tutorials one by one are learning a lot. His thought is that they can be added to our documentation after the contest is over. I think we can re-use some stuff that we've already written, for next year. What do you think?<br /><br />In addition, I'm seeing loads of work -- yes, small jobs, but keep in mind these kids are 13 to 18 years old* - for the teams who were willing to write up tasks and tutor. It is a lot of work so I really appreciate all those mentors who have stepped forward.<br /><br />I'm very glad we are participating this year. It isn't as wild and crazy as it was in the beginning, because there are now lots more orgs involved, so the kids have lots of options. Happy that the kids we have are choosing us!<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />* Rules state: "13 to 17 years old and enrolled in a pre-university educational program" before enrolling.&nbsp;https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/faq<br /><br />

      <i class="author">Wikimedia Foundation</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Last month, the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia community members in Jordan, and Hashemite University—one of the most esteemed higher education institutions in Jordan—signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to advance cultural cooperation and access to free knowledge resources in the Arabic language. It is the first MOU of its type signed with any university in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced at a roundtable discussion hosted at Hashemite University by Katherine Maher, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, and Professor Kamal Bani-Hani, Hashemite University President. They were joined by Hashemite University staff, students, the Wikimedians of the Levant User Group—the local Wikimedia community of volunteer editors—and other guests.</p>
<p>“This relationship with Hashemite University is a critical step in expanding Arabic language free knowledge resources on Wikipedia and on the broader internet. We’re proud to be working with the staff and students of this university to improve Wikipedia while enriching the academic experience of the students across the university,” said Maher.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, the University’s Arabic Online Content Club &#8211; Deanship of Student Affairs will create a standing Wikipedia office at the university to support greater collaboration between both institutions. The office will support students in learning how to contribute to the Wikimedia projects through training by local volunteers. The university will also designate a space in the library to host Wikipedia introductory materials for students and integrate Wikisource, the multilingual digital library of free texts, into the university library search engine. To support these efforts, the Wikimedia Foundation will donate a laptop to the university Wikipedia office.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;This MOU is the product of years of work,&#8221; said Mossab Banat, the originator of the MOU and a member of the Levant User Group, &#8220;and represents a quantum leap in the Wikipedia Education Program&#8217;s capabilities here at the university. We are excited at the potential that this formalized agreement will open for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wikimedia projects have been used in educational settings from the inception of Wikipedia. University professors have found that teaching students how to contribute to Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects is engaging and motivating for students, helping them to learn essential 21st century skills like media literacy, writing and research development, and critical thinking, while content gaps on Wikipedia are filled thanks to students’ efforts. Hashemite University has been supporting Wikimedia in education since 2015 in collaboration with local Wikimedia volunteers. <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/News/November_2017/Hashemite_University_continues_its_strong_support_of_Education_program_activities">Over 500 students</a> participated in 12 courses in 2017, after Banat proposed the idea at a Deans&#8217; council meeting, and by 2018, 54 students <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/News/August_2018/54_students_help_enrich_the_digital_Arabic_content">formalized a university club</a> to focus on improving content on the Arabic Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“Our partnership has enables us to join a growing network of global educational facilities who are using the power of technology to facilitate access to more educational content,” said Prof. Kamal Bani-Hani, President, Hashemite University.</p>
<p>Wikipedia in Jordan is supported by a local community of volunteer editors as part of the Wikimedians of the Levant User Group. Together, volunteers from the user group write and improve articles primarily in Arabic and English Wikipedias and the other Wikimedia projects. Recognized as a formal Wikimedia affiliate in 2015, the Wikimedians of the Levant User Group regularly hosts events to teach more people how to edit Wikipedia and improve the representation of Arabic language content across the Wikimedia projects.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Wikimedia movement and the education sector is overseen by the Wikimedia Foundation in close collaboration with local Wikimedia volunteers around the world. The effort to bring Wikimedia into education has grown to involve programs in all parts of the world, at every education level, and using every Wikimedia project.</p>

        <h3>A galloping overview</h3>
<p>As we have done before, let’s get a bird’s-eye view of the parts of the search process: text comes in and <strong>gets processed</strong> and stored in a database (called an index); a user submits a query; documents that match the query are retrieved from the index, ranked based on how well they match the query, and presented to the user. That sounds easy enough, but each step hides a wealth of detail. Today we’ll focus on the last part of the step where “text gets processed”—and look at stemming, stop words, and thesauri.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that, as discussed in more depth in the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/07/anatomy-search-token-affection/">first installment in this series</a>, humans and computers have very different strengths, and what is easy for one can be incredibly hard for the other.</p>
<h3>The magic of morphology<sup>[1]</sup></h3>
<p>For the most straightforward kinds of search, the most important element of the grammar of most languages is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)">morphology</a>—the study of how words are put together from smaller pieces; in English, these pieces are generally prefixes, suffixes, and stems (also called roots in some grammatical traditions). Other elements of grammar, such as phonetics and phonology (relating to sounds) and syntax (how words are built up into sentences) usually don’t matter as much for search—though for some languages, the boundaries between such elements can be a lot blurrier than they are in English.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59474"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59474" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/independently.png?w=750" alt="" width="750" height="350" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">A breakdown of the morphology and parts of speech of the English word <em>independently</em>.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>In addition to prefixes at the beginning and suffixes at the end of words, other languages have infixes in the middle—English has a limited set of slangy infixes, as in the lightly bowdlerized <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fucking-#Infix"><em>absofreakinglutely</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-iz-#English"><em>hizouse</em></a> (see <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_infixes">more English infixes</a> from Wiktionary)—and multi-part circumfixes that go <em>around</em> another word.</p>
<p>Other interesting morphological phenomena include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic">clitics</a>, which are morphological elements that act like words syntactically, but like affixes phonologically.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication">reduplication</a>, which repeats all or part of a word, as in English “schm-reduplication” (e.g., <em>fancy-schmancy</em>) or “contrastive focus reduplication” in which the repeating of an element indicates that it is “real” or “pure” or “prototypical” (as in, “you can put a bucket on your head and call it a hat, but that doesn’t make it a <em>hat</em>-hat”).</li>
</ul>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59475"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59475" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Reduplication.png?w=814" alt="" width="814" height="426" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">Distribution of reduplication as a regular part of a languages around the world. It’s not common in European languages, but it’s pretty common everywhere else!</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(linguistics)">noun incorporation</a>, in which a noun gets folded into a verb to limit its scope. English has a wee bit of such incorporation in words like <em>backstabbing</em> or <em>babysitting,</em> but some languages do it much more frequently and with vigor!</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophony">ablaut</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_umlaut">umlaut</a>, in which a vowel change indicates an inflection. There are remnants of these processes in English in paradigms like <em>foot/feet</em> and <em>sing/sang/sung</em> that are now considered irregular. In other languages, like German, this is a common regular process.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, generic English morphology is rather boring as these things go. That turns out to be good for search in English because the general morphological rules are comparatively simple (despite the interesting irregular exceptions, and the fact that English spelling is atrocious—which does sometimes make things a bit harder than they need to be).</p>
<h3>The root of the problem</h3>
<p>The reason that morphology matters for search is that we generally want related forms of a word to match each other when we perform a search. For example, English <em>hope, hopes, hoped,</em> and<em> hoping</em> are all reasonable matches if you search for <em>hope.</em> This is generally accomplished through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> which tries to reduce a word to an approximation of its stem or root form.</p>
<p>For you hard core text analysis nerds out there, we can distinguish stemming from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation">lemmatization</a>. The goal of stemming is for all words that are related to be reduced to the same stem (even if that stem is not the true root form or even an actual word) and for unrelated words to be reduced to different stems. Lemmatization, on the other hand, is only successful if the result is the “lemma” of a word, or the exact root form of a word, like you&#8217;d expect to find in a dictionary. This is the definition of <em>lemma</em> that is used in so many categories on English Wiktionary. Since “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lemma#English">lemma</a>” is its own lemma in English, one of its categories is “English lemmas” (and another of its categories is “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_autological_terms">English autological terms</a>”—neat!).</p>
<p>Trying to generate lemmas is in theory a good way to do stemming because if the results are true lemmas, then words with the same stem are going to mostly be related to each other.<sup>[3]</sup> However, in practice, because English spelling <em>is</em> atrocious,<sup>[4]</sup> generating accurate lemmas can be expensive because it often comes down to having an extensive list of exceptions—and not just for the obvious irregular paradigms like <em>be/am/is/are/was/were, child/children, ox/oxen, sing/sang/sung,</em> etc.<sup>[5]</sup> However, as alluded to above, sometimes a somewhat inaccurate rule will suffice.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59476"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59476" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Muskox_BELA_Two_Adults_and_COY_by_Jason_Gablask_15654129683.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="767" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">Oxen, which is a now irregular plural of ox, takes the historical plural marker <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-en#Etymology_2">-en</a>.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>For example, the lemma of <em>begging</em> is <em>beg,</em> but the lemma of <em>egging</em> is <em>egg</em> (yep, it can be a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egg#Verb">verb</a>). A general stemming rule that replaces <em>-gg</em> and <em>-gging</em> with <em>-g,</em> for example, will give an non-lemma stem for <em>egg</em> and <em>egging</em> of <em>eg,</em> and will conflate names like <em>Flagg</em> and <em>Bragg</em> with the more common words <em>flag</em> and <em>brag,</em> but overall it works pretty well for words ending in <em>g.</em> The stemmer we use on English-language wikis doesn’t actually use this specific rule, though, because English morphological analysis is generally well-developed, and there are very large (but still never complete) dictionaries in use behind the scenes.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
<p>Despite the challenges offered by English spelling, English morphology is comparatively very easy. There aren’t that many forms to contend with: <em>-s, -ed,</em> and <em>-ing</em> cover most inflected forms of nouns and verbs. A few other derivational forms like <em>-ly</em> and <em>-er</em> are used to make related words.<sup>[7]</sup> Compare that with a few dozens forms of a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Spanish_verbs">Spanish verb</a> and a couple thousand forms for a <a href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~fkarlsso/genkau2.html">Finnish noun</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_noun_cases">so many cases</a>!—though many combinations may never come up, they are very regular, which makes them relatively easy to generate and understand).</p>
<p>English is fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language">analytic</a>, so we use word order, and other separate words like auxiliaries and prepositions to indicate the grammatical relations in a sentence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language">Agglutinating</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_language">polysynthetic</a> languages can smash a whole sentence into a single “word”. A favorite example among linguists is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubykh_language">Ubykh</a>’s “aχʲazbatɕʼaʁawdətʷaajlafaqʼajtʼmadaχ,” which means “if only you had not been able to make him take it all out from under me again for them.” For Ubykh (which, unfortunately, has gone extinct), any morphological software would have to be a <em>lot</em> more complex than what we have for English.</p>
<h3>Balancing accuracy and complexity</h3>
<p>For stemmers in general there are always potential trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Fortunately stemming in many languages is an<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"> 80/20</a> kind of problem—so you can get good results with a fairly simple process, while on the other hand you may never reach 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>The simplest stemmers are typically rule-based, and simply try to remove affixes from a word and maybe change the resulting stem a little bit so it is more likely to match other related stems. These stemmers are fast and work on words they&#8217;ve never seen before, but also may make more mistakes,<sup>[8]</sup> and may or may not handle common exceptions (like <em>be/been/is/am/are/was/were</em> or <em>sing/sang/sung</em> in English). A very influential rules-based stemmer for English is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Porter">Porter Stemmer</a>.</p>
<p>More complex stemmers or lemmatizers can use a dictionary for exceptions, and then apply rules to anything that&#8217;s not in the dictionary. Of course, the dictionary still can&#8217;t handle words it doesn&#8217;t know, though you can have heuristics to try to match parts of words, too, so that a dictionary entry for <em>national</em> could apply to <em>international, multinational,</em> <em>transnational, binational, supernational, subnational, supranational,</em> etc.</p>
<p>A much more complex approach is to use a statistical or machine-learning model, which should be able to generalize from the examples it trained on to new ones that are similar. Such models can find and exploit interesting patterns, but can also give <em>terrible</em> answers when given really unexpected input. For example, Elasticsearch—the search engine that our on-wiki search is built on—endorses a statistical stemmer for Polish that we deployed on Polish-language wikis; it does a good job on the vast majority of Polish words, but sometimes goes a bit off the rails when it gets input consisting of certain numbers or English words—which, of course, occur often in the Polish Wikipedia!<sup>[9]</sup> We’ve since added filters to ignore the most predictable and egregious errors; we now rely on exact matching for those search terms, which we’ll talk about more in a later post on indexes.</p>
<p>As mentioned in footnote 3—you <em>are</em> reading the footnotes, right?—some forms are ambiguous on their own. For example, <em>can</em> can mean “to be able to” or can be a metal cylinder, and <em>does</em> can be a form of <em>do</em> or the plural of <em>doe.</em> Recognizing parts of speech—e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.—can help in cases like this, since these ambiguous forms differ in their part of speech. However distinguishing others, like <em>putting</em>—which can be a form of <em>put</em> or of <em>putt</em>—would require an incredible level of contextual and real-world information—the kind of thing that is easy for humans and hard for computers: “After <em>putting</em> the ball into the hole, I saw her <em>putting</em> the club into her bag.” This level of natural language processing is often not available, and is generally not worth the massive increase in complexity to bump stemming performance from 99% to 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>The stemmer used on English-language wikis comes bundled with Elasticsearch, which provides stemmers and other language processing for<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-lang-analyzer.html"> almost three dozen languages</a>; third-party plugins are also available for others, like Polish. For languages with a larger search volume and no language analysis plugins from Elasticsearch, we’ve adapted other third-party open-source morphological analysis software for use with Elasticsearch. We’ve adapted software for Slovak and for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; we worked with a developer to build something new for Esperanto; and we were able to apply existing analysis software for Indonesian to Malay.<sup>[10]</sup> The new stemmers for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian, Slovak, and Esperanto aren’t perfect, but they do take advantage of the 80/20 nature of stemming, and have improved the quality of search results in those languages.</p>
<h3>To be or not to be indexed</h3>
<p>Once we’ve got our stemmed forms of the words from our text, we might want to throw some of them away! “Stop words” are words that don’t usually carry a lot of meaning and appear frequently—often function words like prepositions (<em>to, of, at, from</em>) and determiners (<em>a, an, the</em>) or common, generic words (like <em>make, do, be</em>)—and so can be ignored and not put in the index. Back in the very early days of full-text search, there was also a matter of saving space in the search index, because stop words tend to occur frequently; nowadays that’s usually not much of a concern.</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes a useful phrase can be made up entirely of stop words. Choosing the exact list used for any application is more of an art than a science, but <em>be, not, or,</em> and <em>to</em> are all common enough stop words, reducing the famous quote from Shakespeare—“To be or not to be”—unfindable!</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59478"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="size-large wp-image-59478" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lombard_in_To_Be_or_Not_to_Be_1.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="766" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption">A still from the 1942 film <em>To Be or Not to Be</em>, which would be very hard to find on Wikimedia Commons if we ignored all stop words.</span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>One solution is not to have any stop words and use frequency analysis to discount words that would otherwise likely qualify as stop words. For example, <em>lexicalism</em> occurs in only five articles on English Wikipedia, while <em>of</em> occurs in 5.4 million. It’s easy to guess which word is more relevant to our query.</p>
<p>Another approach is to have multiple indexes—some with stop words and some without—and merge their results. We’ll talk more about that in a later post.</p>
<h3>A rose by any other name</h3>
<p>Some search engines support a thesaurus, which allows you to effectively insert synonyms or other related terms into a document, even though they aren’t actually there. For example, while there is a distinction between an <em>attorney</em> and a <em>lawyer,</em> many people outside the legal profession use them interchangeably. A thesaurus could add <em>attorney</em> wherever <em>lawyer</em> occurs, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Elasticsearch supports a thesaurus, but we don’t currently use one on-wiki. The search system we had before Elasticsearch has exactly one entry in its English thesaurus—<em>film</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2194.png" alt="↔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />︎ <em>movie</em>—which makes a lot of sense for English Wikipedia!</p>
<p>Building and maintaining a thesaurus that’s any bigger than that has traditionally required careful planning and knowledge of the search domain—which for Wikipedia is pretty much everything. However, some researchers have gotten good results from automatically generated thesauri that use co-occurrence of terms in documents to find related terms; these thesauri are often less about specific synonyms and more about expanding a search with useful related terms.</p>
<p>We don’t currently have any concrete plans to build or enable thesauri for on-wiki search, but it is on our long-term radar.</p>
<h3>Further reading / Homework</h3>
<p><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/amir-aharoni/">Amir Aharoni</a>, Language Strategist at the WMF, did a nice presentation titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xJaqQV71s">The English Language as a Privilege</a>” that touches on a lot of the ways that computers are better at dealing with English, whether because of particular features of English, as we discussed above, or because of the fact that many computer systems were originally developed by English speakers.</p>
<p>If you can’t wait for next time, I put together a poorly edited and mediocrely presented video in January of 2018, available on Commons, that covers the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BareBonesSearch.webm">Bare-Bones Basics of Full-Text Search</a>. It starts with no prerequisites, and covers tokenization and stemming, inverted indexes, basic boolean and proximity retrieval operations, TF/IDF and the vector space model of similarity, field-level indexing, using multiple indexes, and then touches on some of the elements of scoring.</p>
<h3>Up next</h3>
<p>In my next blog post, we’ll look at inverted indexes and maybe touch on queries and retrieval operations.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>1.</strong> Or, one could say, “the glamour of grammar”—<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glamour#English"><em>glamour</em></a> has a older and now less common meaning: a magical spell. We know that <em>glamour</em> came to English through Scots, and one possible previous step in its etymology is that it branched off an earlier English meaning of<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grammar#English"> <em>grammar</em></a><em>,</em> which is given in Wiktionary as “any sort of scholarship, especially occult learning”. By the way, the letter <em>r</em> changing to an <em>l</em> isn’t at all out of the question; it’s a kind of sound change called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissimilation"> dissimilation</a> and it often happens to r’s and l’s. It explains the pronunciation/spelling split in English <em>colonel,</em> and the difference between the related words <em>pilgrim</em> and <em>peregrine</em> (both kinds of travelers or wanderers).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>2.</strong> Clitics are interesting, but complicated, so their more complex explanation is relegated to a footnote, alas. Some linguists argue differently, but English possessive <em>-’s</em> can be seen as a clitic. Phonologically—that is, sound-wise—it is not a separate word. Like past tense <em>-ed</em> or plural <em>-s</em> when spoken it is clearly part of the word it attaches to. But unlike <em>-ed</em> which must attach to a verb, or plural <em>-s</em> which must attach to a noun, possessive <em>-’s</em> comes at the end of a noun <em>phrase,</em> and so can end up attached to almost any part of speech.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Consider hats that belong to many different people: <em>Robin’s hat</em> (<em>-’s</em> attaches to a proper noun), <em>the child’s hat</em> (attached to a common noun), <em>the boy whose hair is green’s hat</em> (adjective); <em>the girl who walks quickly’s hat</em> (adverb), <em>the person I’m thinking of’s hat</em> (preposition), <em>the person Fred said liked him’s hat</em> (pronoun). Any word that can be placed at the end of a noun phrase can have <em>-’s</em> attached to it. Examples with determiners (like <em>the</em>) and conjunctions (like <em>and</em>) are only hard to come by because noun phrases don’t typically end with those parts of speech. But if we invoke the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction"> use–mention distinction</a> and use quoted speech, we can find an example where <em>-’s</em> attaches to <em>the,</em> and create a train wreck of apostrophes in the process: <em>the linguist who said “my favorite word is ‘the’ ” ’s hat.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>3.</strong> Even with generally accurate lemmas, there are some problem cases. Some words are ambiguous, but only in certain forms. A good example is <em>can,</em> which can be a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_verb#English"> defective verb</a> meaning “to be able”, a noun referring to a metal cylinder, or a related verb meaning to put things in cans. The forms <em>canning</em> and <em>cans</em> are clearly the metal cylinder kind, but their lemma, <em>can,</em> is ambiguous. Similarly, the verb <em>do</em> and the noun <em>doe</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-Re-Mi#Word_meanings">a deer, a female deer</a>) are not easily confused as lemmas, but the form <em>does</em> is, at least in writing. Similarly, <em>putting</em> could be a form of either <em>put</em> or <em>putt.</em> Have I mentioned that English spelling is atrocious?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>4.</strong> I like to say that there aren’t really any spelling <em>rules</em> in English, only moderately useful <em>suggestions.</em> There are a few famous examples of the… uh… let’s say “idiosyncrasies”… of English spelling that always bear repeating:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti"> <em>ghoti</em></a>—with the <em>gh</em> in <em>laugh,</em> the <em>o</em> in <em>women,</em> and the <em>ti</em> in <em>nation</em>—sounds like “fish”. Mapping <em>ghoughpteighbteau</em> to “potato” is left as an exercise for the reader. Non-native speakers of English who want to torture themselves should try to read a brutal poem by Gerard Nolst Trenité about English spelling, appropriately titled “The Chaos”. Even native speakers of English may find it challenging. It’s available on<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ruize-rijmen/De_Chaos"> Wikisource</a>. For some insight into how we ended up with this mess, see more about the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography#History"> history of English orthography</a> on English Wikipedia.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>5.</strong> English <em>be</em> is an incomplete<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/be#Etymology"> melding of three(!) different verbs</a>, <em>sing</em> is an old<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_strong_verb"> strong verb</a>, and <em>children</em> and <em>oxen</em> show the remnants of an older Germanic system of pluralization from Old English. Eventually, all of these irregularities may disappear—as many others already have—through a process known as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_leveling"> leveling</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>6.</strong> Those English dictionaries include some interesting mappings, too. For example, the stem for <em>french</em> is <em>france,</em> for <em>german</em> it’s <em>germany,</em> for <em>italian</em> it’s <em>italy,</em> for <em>holland</em> it’s <em>dutch,</em> and for <em>filipino</em> it’s <em>philippines.</em> This works out well for certain locutions in English, making “president of france” and “french president” essentially the same (see more on the treatment of <em>of</em> in the section on stop words). The fact that most pairs map the adjective to the country while <em>holland</em> and <em>dutch</em> go the other way doesn’t matter much because the result is only used internally by the search engine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>7.</strong> Affixes that give a variant of the same word (<em>hope, hopes, hoped, hoping</em>) are called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection#Inflectional_morphology"> inflectional affixes</a>, while affixes that give a related but distinct word (like <em>hope </em>→ <em>hopeful,</em> <em>quick </em>→ <em>quickly, word </em>→ <em>wordy,</em> or <em>work </em>→ <em>worker</em>) are called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation"> derivational affixes</a>. Stemmers generally try to unify words that are inflections of the root form. Whether or not derived forms should be included depends on the goals of whoever is creating the stemmer. It&#8217;s like deciding what forms to list in a dictionary. Should related forms—especially those whose meaning is predictable—all be listed under one headword (stem/lemma/root), or should they get their own entries? In English, <em>words</em> definitely belongs under <em>word</em> and <em>hoping</em> belongs under <em>hope,</em> but do <em>wordy</em> and <em>hopefully</em> get their own entries or not? It&#8217;s a judgement call.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>8.</strong> A really common source of mistakes for rule-based stemmers comes from words that look like they have affixes on them, but don’t. For example, surnames like <em>Belcher, Childers,</em> or <em>Johns,</em> which can have their final <em>-er, -ers,</em> or <em>-s</em> stripped off. More common names, like <em>Jones</em> and <em>Edwards,</em> may be known exceptions and thus left untouched. Ironically, the name <em>Stemmer</em> is likely to be incorrectly but understandably stemmed to <em>stem.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>9.</strong> Some of the examples I found when reviewing the Polish stemmer are listed on <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:TJones_(WMF)/Notes/Stempel_Analyzer_Analysis/Error_Examples">MediaWiki</a>. The worst is the stem <em>ć,</em> which is the infinitive verb ending in Polish. Lots of completely unrelated words—like <em>Adrien, Button, Coins, Drag, Espinho, Frau, Girl, Hague, Issue, Judas, Keiki, Laws, Mammal, Nuxalk, Oloś, Pearl, Qaab, Rogue, Shingle, Trask, Uniw, Value, Wheel, XXIII, Yzaga,</em> and <em>Zizinho,</em> just to name a few—get reduced to the <em>ć</em> ending by some overzealous bit of statistical machinery inside the stemmer. Fortunately the words that it makes mistakes on are fairly rare, and we’ve added filters to improve the results.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>10.</strong> We have one stemmer for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian, and one for Indonesian and Malay. The languages in these two groups are closely related and have the same basic morphology even where they differ in vocabulary, spelling, pronunciation, or writing system. As an analogy, US and UK English differ in the spelling of <em>color/colour</em> or <em>realize/realise,</em> and in the vocabulary for <em>truck/lorry,</em> but the rules for inflecting those words are the same as general English words—<em>colors/colours, realizing/realising, trucks/lorries</em>—so the same stemmer can be used without knowing which variety we are dealing with. The situation is similar—but with potentially much more distinctiveness between varieties—for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_standard_Bosnian,_Croatian,_Montenegrin_and_Serbian">Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian</a> and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Standard_Malay_and_Indonesian">Indonesian and Malay</a>.</p>

        <h2>Reason for the blog</h2> <p>I&#8217;m changing KDE startup/shutdown a lot, whilst I aim to keep everything working exactly as before, please test this part thoroughly and report if you see any issues in the 5.15 cycle.</p> <h2>What is ksmserver?</h2> <p>In theory ksmserver is an X session manager.<br /> An X session manager is responsible for saving/restoring your session when you log out and in<br /> (and subsessions if you use activities) as well as prompting all your applications if it&#8217;s safe to log out.</p> <p>Currently this is one of the most important processes of the plasma session. Killing this process will immediately end the session.</p> <p>As it runs all session it&#8217;s a bit of a dumping ground for:<br /> &#8211; handling all autostart (including plasmashell etc)<br /> &#8211; running shutdown scripts<br /> &#8211; screensaver<br /> &#8211; some global shortcuts about session management<br /> &#8211; spawning the logout prompts<br /> &#8211; invoking the actual shutdown</p> <h2>Why change it?</h2> <p>As ksmserver handles startup our wayland session depends on X (or rather Xwayland), this is slower as we have to spawn it on startup, as well as being problematic for alternative devices where Xwayland may not be a useful option.</p> <p>Also if we come up with a new session manager protocol that works well with wayland, we will need to replace just the session manager part.</p> <p>Equally we have attempts to replace startup with for example, systemd units (and yes, there&#8217;d be a fallback) where we still want a working session manager.</p> <p>In addition, some of the code isn&#8217;t in the best state. It dates back to the 90s, without really having an active maintainer. There&#8217;s been some significant changes to the way linux desktops work since that time. There&#8217;s a lot to be cleaned up.</p> <h2>The plan</h2> <p>The golden rule is to refactor not rewrite. There have been numerous attempts at redoing startup, all good tech demos, but none are usable for production as they don&#8217;t pay attention to matching with the current state and intricate startup hooks, something we need when we&#8217;re talking about enterprise deployment who will have customisations.</p> <p>The end goal is for KSMServer to be just an xsessionmanager. Allowing wayland-compatiable competitors to come alongside or potentially replace it down the line.</p> <p>Startup and Shutdown will become multiple independent binaries (unix philosophy style) allowing them to be individually replaced all tied together with DBus activation. They will also be refactored to be considerably more readable.</p> <h2>Current state</h2> <p>There&#8217;s been an internal refactor, which has been merged in master, the next step is to split into different processes once we&#8217;ve had feedback on the current work. </p>

It was the second leg of a three weeks long trip across the Americas that began with a company meeting in the US.</p> <figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_420" style="width: 300px;"><a href="http://blog.broulik.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181107_174544.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-420" height="222" src="http://blog.broulik.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181107_174544-300x222.jpg" width="300" /></a>Bad weather in Atlanta made for some gorgeous scenery</figure> <p>After a ten hour flight on the Airbus A330 pictured, I arrived at&#160;Guarulhos airport in the morning. I was lucky to have found myself on a half-empty plane with an entire row of seats for me alone. The conference lasted Thursday to Sunday with the first two days reserved for embedded programming and 3D development trainings. Not having signed up for any of these, I took the opportunity to explore the city on Friday. I visited the&#160;Museu de Arte de S&#227;o Paulo (MASP) and walked over to the district of Liberdade which is home to the largest Japanese community outside Japan. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t visit the&#160;Museum of the Japanese Immigration as they didn&#8217;t accept credit cards.</p> <figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_421" style="width: 300px;"><a href="http://blog.broulik.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181111_094122.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-421" height="222" src="http://blog.broulik.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_20181111_094122-300x222.jpg" width="300" /></a>Plasma for Device Creation</figure> <p>Saturday and Sunday is when the main talks happened. With my rudimentary Latin and Spanish knowledge I tried to make the most of them, since they were all held in Portugese. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed the talks about Qt for Python, a live demo of a setup using Boot to Qt, and Qt &#8220;for Robots&#8221;.</p> <p>My speech was Sunday morning, entitled &#8220;Plasma for Device Creation&#8221; where I explained to the audience what Plasma is, how flexible it is, and that it can be virtually anything you want it to be. An important part of the presentation was to present ways to get in touch with the KDE Community and who to approach when you want to realize this amazing product vision you might have. While there was no recording of my talk, I&#8217;m expecting my slides to be available for download on their website shortly.</p> <p>Many thanks to the organizers of QtCon Brasil for hosting the event, spreading the word about Qt down there, and inviting me over to my first trip to the South American continent!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_Tuesday">Giving Tuesday</a>, the Wikimedia Foundation begins its annual banner campaign on the English Wikipedia, inviting anyone who values Wikipedia to join us on our journey and support  its continued growth and evolution as the world’s free knowledge resource. Banners will appear on the English Wikipedia asking our readers to consider contributing to the site with a donation.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is the only top website that is supported entirely by a nonprofit. Our fundraising appeal is an opportunity for us to remind everyone what makes Wikipedia possible. At its core, Wikipedia runs on generosity: the generous volunteers, readers, editors, and donors who find value in Wikipedia and want to give something back to it.</p>
<p>When you give back to Wikipedia, you&#8217;re not only supporting its continued growth and longevity. You&#8217;re also supporting the sustaining values and vision behind Wikipedia: free, neutral, and fact-based knowledge for every person, everywhere.</p>
<p>While Wikipedia continues to reliably answer billions of the world’s questions each year, here at the Wikimedia Foundation, we focus on solving the challenges we still face. <em>But nearly eighteen years in, we&#8217;re still a long way from achieving our vision</em>—Wikipedia does not yet serve the whole world. We’re not even close. So this year, our goal is to improve Wikipedia’s usability. We want to expand access and participation in emerging economies, and welcome more women and non-binary readers and editors to our ranks. We will advocate for online privacy and freedom of information to <a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/">protect the policies that allow Wikipedia and the broader free internet ecosystem to thrive</a>. As long as the internet exists, we pledge that Wikipedia will strive to make it a better place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some of the work we&#8217;ve done in the past year, thanks to our generous donors, and a few things we&#8217;re hoping to achieve in those to come.</p>
<p><strong>We are expanding access to Wikipedia&#8217;s knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>Jakarta is almost 14,000 kilometers from San Francisco.  Bangalore is nearly 8,000 kilometers from the Netherlands. That&#8217;s why we <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/04/24/new-data-center-singapore/">opened a new datacenter in Singapore</a>, which has decreased the time required to deliver a page throughout the Asia-Pacific region—in Singapore itself, we&#8217;ve seen an improvement of over 40 percent. For those with little to no internet access, we&#8217;re working to bridge the gap with an <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/New_Readers/Wikipedia_Offline_Medical_Pilot">offline medical pilot</a> that will deploy Wi-Fi hotspots (&#8220;<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Internet-in-a-Box">Internet-in-a-Box</a>&#8220;) to healthcare providers in all 36 states in Nigeria. These boxes use <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/18/wikimedia-foundation-and-kiwix-partner-to-grow-offline-access-to-wikipedia/">Kiwix</a>, a way of serving content and software to individuals and other NGOs to support people with little or no internet access, and have already been deployed and studied in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and in Syrian refugee camps.</p>
<p><strong>We are making it easier for people to translate content into their own languages.</strong></p>
<p>Many science fiction stories provide for a &#8216;universal translator&#8217;, often using it as a convenient plot device to quickly allow individuals from two or more species to communicate from their first words. Unfortunately, we here on Earth-prime haven&#8217;t yet developed such a thing, and so translation across Wikipedias in hundreds of languages is critically important: it allows multilingual editors to re-use efforts made by other volunteer editors, thereby lowering the cost of spreading knowledge across the world.</p>
<p>This is why we built a <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation">content translation tool</a>—it simplifies the translation process, making it easier to bring the sum of all knowledge into your own languages. The tool has been used to create more than 350,000 Wikipedia articles since launching in January 2015, and its success led us to construct a <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/30/content-translation-version-two/">new, improved version</a>, which we beta-released this year.</p>
<p><strong>We support efforts to address Wikipedia&#8217;s gender bias.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/18/wikipedia-mirror-world-gender-biases/">Wikipedia has a gender bias</a>. While we strive for Wikipedia’s collection of knowledge to contain the full, rich diversity of all humanity, the same requirements that help ensure that what you read on the encyclopedia is accurate and verifiable also systemically disadvantage underrepresented groups of people, including women. <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/our-work/what-wikipedia-is-doing-about-gender-diversity/">We&#8217;re working to change this</a> by adding criteria to make our events more inclusive, issuing grants to volunteers to solicit and support ideas to address these issues (including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/WVU/Welcome">first Wikipedian-in-Residence for gender equity</a>), funding hundreds of in-person events that support increased gender diversity, and commissioning a report on the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/21/advancing-gender-equity-conversations-with-movement-leaders/">current state of our gender equity efforts</a>. We also <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/13/jess-wade/">vocally support the work of volunteer editors like Jess Wade</a>, a physicist working to increase the number of underrepresented scientists and engineers on Wikipedia.</p>
<p><strong>We are working to develop and understand the pros and cons of AI.</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligences (AIs) have grown ever more popular in recent years and have proven to be very useful in a wide variety of contexts. We see them as a potential boost for Wikipedia, taking some of the burden of maintaining and curating the encyclopedia off its core of volunteer editors. However, AIs have also proved that they have the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities and limit the diversity of our participants. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/01/wikimedia-joins-partnership-on-ai/">joined the Partnership on AI</a>, a coalition of partners working together to better understand and draft best practices on the impact of artificial intelligence technologies on people and the planet, and <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/10/mitigating-biases-artificial-intelligences-wikipedian-way/">designed a tool to make the work of critiquing our AIs easier</a>, by providing standardized ways to agree or disagree with an AI’s judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p>Thank you to the millions of donors and editors who made the past year’s accomplishments possible. We are far from finished with our work. There is much left to do, and we’re excited to address these new challenges and more as we enter into 2019. If you care about this work, please support it.

        <p>KDAB is presenting two great talks at Qt World Summit. At 13:30, you can get an in-depth look at a new concept for designers and developers with James Turner.</p> <p>At 14:30, Milian Wolff will be presenting some of KDAB&#8217;s renowned opensource tools, some of which, like Hotspot, he created himself.</p> <h4>Streamlined integration of 3D content straight from 3DS Max and Blender into Qt3D</h4> <p>with James Turner</p> <p>Qt 3D is now established as the ideal 3D rendering engine for cross platform applications needing to integrate 3D content with 2D interfaces in a seamless way. The scene graph lets <img align="right" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11254" height="200" src="https://www.kdab.com/wp-content/uploads/stories/jamesT.png" style="margin: 15px 0 15px 15px;" width="133" />developers import and control geometry and materials, while the frame graph can be used to build advanced rendering&#160; effects with ease.&#8232;&#8232; However, just as in the case of 2D content, best results are achieved when designers and developer share a common experience and toolset. Yet the tools used to author 3D scenes, the geometry, the materials, the lighting, the animations, are all very different from what most developers are familiar with.</p> <p>In this talk, we introduce techniques and principles which make the collaboration between designers and developers smoother. We identify the major pain points and highlight tools and patterns for addressing each of them. We will look at data formats, model conditioning, runtime integration and rendering effects in order to produce compelling applications integrating 3D content with a traditional 2D interface.</p> <p>We will illustrate all these concepts with a running example.</p> <h4>KDAB&#8217;s Opensource Tools for Qt</h4> <p>with Milian Wolff</p> <p>Richard Feynman is considered one of the greatest physicists, largely because he was able to build lots of practical mathematical tools that greatly simplify the analysis of complex<img align="right" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-19052" height="200" src="https:&#x2f;&#x2f;&#x77;&#x77;&#x77;&#x2e;&#107;&#100;ab&#46;com&#x2f;&#x77;&#x70;&#x2d;&#x63;&#x6f;&#110;&#116;ent/up&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x61;&#x64;&#x73;&#x2f;&#115;&#116;&#111;ries/&#x6d;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x57;&#45;&#54;6x100&#64;&#x32;&#x78;&#x2d;&#x31;&#x2e;&#x70;&#110;&#103;" style="margin: 15px 0 15px 15px;" width="132" /> phenomena, thus making them accessible and useful to many.</p> <p>KDAB maintains its position as the leading Qt consulting firm, partly because of the huge effort KDAB&#8217;s top-class engineers put into R&amp;D projects to build great tooling for Qt applications. This tooling has helped countless other engineers solve bugs in their code, fix performance issues and prevent more problems from slipping into codebases.</p> <p>The cherry on top of all this Qt goodness is that KDAB publishes its tooling under Opensource licenses!</p> <p>Come to this talk if you want to discover how KDAB&#8217;s awesome Opensource Tools for Qt can help you.</p> <p>View the full agenda <a href="https://www.qtworldsummit.com/2018/berlin/?__hssc=152220518.1.1543247424698&amp;__hstc=152220518.7084d136e6ba83c117b187ca74f98de1.1541172971007.1542402428124.1543247424698.16&amp;__hsfp=3956988724&amp;hsCtaTracking=6205686c-336f-478c-8315-bc7e56885f2b%7C8590b015-e9c7-4616-9828-772559cb58b9">here</a>.

        <h1>Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit Report</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In mid-October <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sumantrom">Sumantro Mukherjee</a> and <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mbriza/">Martin Bříza</a> attended the Mentor Summit for this year’s Google Summer of Code in Sunnyvale, California, USA. Besides talking about the hard points of the program, its future direction and ways how to improve the participation in it, it’s a great place to discover many interesting open source software (and even hardware!) projects. And most importantly, you get to meet the people who stand behind those projects.<span id="more-6681"></span></p>
<h2>Google Summer of Code 2019</h2>
<p>There will be a GSoC 2019, despite all the rumors about the project getting cancelled, which is a great news for all of us! The exact shape and form of the next year’s iteration has not been decided yet, but there was a session to gather input on the topic. Some of the more interesting suggestions were to do two separate programs for both hemispheres, for example.</p>
<h3>Google Season of Docs</h3>
<p>This was an exciting new announcement by Google because up until now, GSoC has been focused only on the coding, which was a delimiting participation of FLOSS enthusiasts who cannot or don’t want to code. Google is still gathering and processing input on this topic, but the current tentative plan is for it to start it’s first run no later than next end of April 2019 with the GSoD the orgs being announced.  GSoD will be targeted towards people experienced Technical Writers, passion to improve projects will mostly be the driving factor. GSoD will mainly focus on increasing awareness of OSS and OSS Docs as a spectrum of contribution to mainstream technical writers. Google envisions this program which will help OSS projects to implement a brand new doc site or refactor the existing ones, setting up high-impact infographic tutorials which students can follow easily.</p>
<h3>Sessions</h3>
<p>The Mentor Summit is organized as an unconference, that means anybody can propose a topic for a session and then these proposals get voted on and the most popular ones are actually held in an assigned room at the venue.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of sessions organized by Google, especially those about announcements or to talk about GSoC itself. The topics of the rest then varied greatly. Martin attended sessions on how to get new mentors and then a session on how to actually keep them during the Summer (those are actually two different topics). There was also a very informative session about FLOSS licensing that means the difference between various licenses, their compatibility and what they actually mean to the authors and the users, from the point of view of a lawyer.</p>
<p>Some of the other topics tackled during the weekend were for example Open Robotics, Open Science and of course Open Source games.</p>
<p>Sumantro attended the sessions related to GSoD and what can be done to improve the documentation of projects. Sumantro deep dived in discussions and talks where the focus was Google Code. A better understanding of what a bite size task and about the upcoming deadlines were mostly the two key takeaways. He spent a lot of time understanding how other Orgs are participating in GSoC and GCI. Mostly focusing on, how to retain contributors in their projects.</p>
<p>This year’s GCI is underway Fedora has taken part with 200+ tasks being mentored and completed so far by 100+ students.</p>

<h3>
Chocolate Table and Swags</h3>
<p>This was definitely a blast, we had chocolates coming in from different parts of the world.<br />
Google puts out a lot of swags for mentors to take for themselves and their community members. This time there were a lot of t-shirts, pens, stickers, GSoC socks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

<h3>Prepping for next GSoC Mentor Summit</h3>
<p>There are few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to write a clear objective proposal for “why” do you want to chosen for Mentor summit to the Org Admins. This may include how your presence will benefit the project.</li>
<li>Collaboration and expressing yourself is important, make sure to submit a talk about how and what your students worked on throughout the GSoC. Keep in mind, you will be given on 2 mins and the pitch shouldn’t ideally contain much about the org rather should contain the best thing the students have created that summer.</li>
<li>Carry chocolates and a big bag to carry swags back with you (you’ll get a lot). Plan ahead how you will share the swag with your fellow contributors.</li>
</ul>

        <p>There was a small problem with Qt&#8217;s deployment tools that could, however, cause some struggle for beginners. windeployqt, macdeployqt and linuxdeployqt could not add a third-party Qt Quick module (i.e. one that is not located inside Qt&#8217;s installation directory, like <a href="https://www.kde.org/products/kirigami/">Kirigami</a>) to the resulting bundle.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/ilyabiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/46430465-ad629e80-c751-11e8-8da9-52f1f6316787.png?ssl=1"><img alt="" class="wp-image-376" src="https://i2.wp.com/ilyabiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot_20181126_022015.png?resize=1024%2C433&#038;ssl=1" /></a></figure> <p>It was, of course, possible to workaround the issue by copying the missing files to their expected locations with <a href="https://git.kaidan.im/kaidan/kaidan/blob/master/utils/build-mac.sh#L135">a script</a> or manually. For non-systemwide Qt installations, there was also an option of installing the libraries by side with Qt&#8217;s own modules. However, these are still platform-dependent workarounds we shouldn&#8217;t rely on long-term.</p> <p>I faced this issue when trying to package <a href="http://kaidan.im">Kaidan</a>, a Qt Quick XMPP client, as an AppImage. After a <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/issues/319">discussion</a> with linuxdeployqt&#8217;s contributors and some research, I found that internally the tool uses <code>qmlimportscanner</code> to locate the imported modules, but only passes <code>QT_INSTALL_QML</code> (Qt&#8217;s own modules location) to the scanner. It was clearly missing an option to list custom import paths, like <code>-qmlimport</code>. That was easy to fix, <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/pull/320">and so I did</a>.</p> <p>linuxdeployqt is a fork of macdeployqt, and so I decided it makes sense to upstream my changes. I <a href="https://forum.qt.io/topic/95157/deploying-3rdparty-qt-quick-plugins-on-macos">made sure</a> I&#8217;m not missing anything, then started a <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/242083">Gerrit revision</a>.</p> <p>While my changes were pending approval, I looked into windeployqt&#8217;s sources and submitted a <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/242315">matching revision</a> to that tool.</p> <p>When <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/commit/8b3ded6a4ce66a88a48463caec92a7306e2d0069">all</a> <a href="http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttools.git/commit/?h=dev&amp;id=24189b5f0935914a979b7e9d3786bec8f9f019bc">three</a> <a href="http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttools.git/commit/?h=dev&amp;id=3d3ec897712f590e9e4e5ffad4b7017e235295cb">commits</a> had been merged, I <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/244161">documented</a> my changes.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Starting with Qt 5.13 there&#8217;ll be an option in Qt deployment tools (<code>-qmlimport</code>) to specify custom import paths for Qt Quick libraries. As a nice bonus, this option also allows to choose between multiple versions of a library installed at different locations.

        <p>When debugging window compositing problems with the Wayland client-server protocol, often it is a good idea to set the environment variable &#8220;WAYLAND_DEBUG=1&#8221; and to take a deep look on the messages that are sent via this protocol. But as always, a lot of output is generated and highlighting can help very much. So far, you could use <a href="https://github.com/johanhelsing/wayland-log-reader">Johan&#8217;s excellent QML based highlighter</a> with many cool features (e.g. rainbow colors for different objects).</p> <p>However, in my workflow usually I already have Kate open and simply want to paste a trace therein and to use Kate&#8217;s cool syntax highlighting features. So, yesterday I sat down and created an initial set version of highlighting rules for Wayland trace logs. These rules are already merged and will be available with the next KF5 release.</p> <p>If you do not want to wait until the next KF5 release, just save <a href="https://cgit.kde.org/syntax-highlighting.git/plain/data/syntax/wayland-trace.xml">wayland-trace.xml</a> file to &#8220;~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/&#8221; in your local home folder, restart Kate, and then select the highlighting scheme &#8220;Other -&gt; Wayland Trace&#8221;.<img alt="wayland-log-highlight-example" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-220" src="https://cordlandwehr.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/wayland-log-highlight-example.png?w=630" /></p>

        <p>Now that <a href="https://blog.bembel.net/2018/11/kmymoney-5-0-2-released/">KMyMoney 5.0.2</a> is released, I prepared to upgrade my development system from openSuSE 42.3 to Leap 15.0. This involves creating a drive image comparing the image with the original disk and then running the upgrade procedure. Triggered by a <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2018/07/21/upgrading-opensuse-leap-150" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on <a href="https://planet.kde.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">planet KDE</a> by fellow KDE developer dfaure I expected some trouble ahead and took extra care to have a good backup.<br /></p> <p>In the past, I had run the update directly from the iso image which I also did this time just to learn that it fails whatever I tried to do. Apparently, the updater became confused with the disk partition layout I am using. This fortunately all happened just before the disk was touched and I got around to restore my backup image every time.<br /></p> <p>It&#8217;s always helpful to have a second system at hand to do some searching on the internet. Using this box, I started to use the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">manual zypper method</a>. A first warning was issued, that using the latest Nouveau/Mesa3D combination is not stable and is not recommended to use with Qt applications and the KDE desktop. Well, that&#8217;s exactly what I use and want, so I decided to answer the obvious confirmation with no which resulted in the abort of the whole update process and left me at the CLI prompt.</p> <p>Now what? I don&#8217;t want to risk the system but have no choice at that point. So I decided to go for it anyway and see what happens. If anything really goes wrong I can always restore my image and start afresh. Options then could be to remove the Mesa stuff on 42.3 or replace Nouveau with the proprietary NVidia drivers. So on the second trial I answered &#8216;yes&#8217; and kept my fingers crossed.<br /></p> <p>After&#160; downloading about 3 GB off the net it started to run the installation. Messages were flying by and I noticed some of them were warnings, some of them seemed to be errors (as displayed in another color) and I expected some major problems ahead. In the end, around 3.600 packages were installed and to my surprise, the system came up after the usual reboot without problems. Even my ciphered partition was no problem. No problems on the graphics UI front so I logged into my account. Plasma came up and was running. On to some tests.</p> <p>WiFi to the home network is working out of the box. This used to be a problem during the last upgrade. Started a VirtualBox VM: comes up, no problems so far. Start the VPN to the home network: no problem. All routes are in place, DNS resolution is working. Cool. Start the VPN to the office: fails. Failure is caused by an old cipher used in the certificate. Guess I have to update that one in the near future then. OK, on to some more endavours.</p> <p>Start the KMyMoney version which I just built before the upgrade. Does not work. Asks for some old library versions which got replaced with newer ones during the upgrade. &#8216;No problem, just recompile and you&#8217;re done&#8217;, I thought. Not really, I needed to rebuild Alkimia as well, as it was causing the trouble. Once done, I was able to build and install KMyMoney: it worked. My personal finance data file (GPG encrypted) opened and all data showed up. Cool, let&#8217;s check the online banking feature and ask the banks for new transactions. The next problem: it does not work. All of it is not present in the menus. Ah, probably also needs to be rebuild.</p> <p>So back to <a href="https://www.aquamaniac.de" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AqBanking</a> (links to a German website) and Gwenhywfar. Once everything was rebuild and installed, I build KMyMoney again because its KBanking plugin was not build due to the absence of AqBanking in the first run. Once compiled I installed it again, et voil&#224;: AqBanking shows up in the settings. Now on to the actual account update&#160; but what is that: a crash after I entered the PIN to my account. This never happened before and should certainly not be the case. Starting a debug session and looking at the backtrace after the crash showed the following:<br /></p> <pre class="wp-block-verse">0 __gmpn_divexact_1_fat() at /usr/lib64/libmpir.so.23<br />1 _nettle_ecc_mod_add() at /usr/lib64/libhogweed.so.4<br />2 _nettle_ecc_dup_jj() at /usr/lib64/libhogweed.so.4<br />3 _nettle_ecc_mul_g() at /usr/lib64/libhogweed.so.4<br />4 nettle_ecdsa_generate_keypair() at /usr/lib64/libhogweed.so.4<br />5 ??() at /usr/lib64/libgnutls.so.30<br />6 ??() at /usr/lib64/libgnutls.so.30<br />7 ??() at /usr/lib64/libgnutls.so.30<br />8 ??() at /usr/lib64/libgnutls.so.30<br />9 gnutls_handshake() at /usr/lib64/libgnutls.so.30<br />10 GWEN_SyncIo_Tls_Connect() at /home/thb/devel/gwenhywfar/src/sio/syncio_tls.c:1144</pre> <p>A bit strange that it fails in the big number math library <a href="http://mpir.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">libmpir</a> where it never failed before.

So it uses libmpir. Let&#8217;s check if it uses the right one or by accident some leftover version from the previous system install, because libmpir was the one that caused the trouble with Alkimia before.

On openSuSE 42.3 libmpir and libgmp came with the same ABI but that might have changed here.<br /></p> <p>Next try was then to uninstall libmpir using the package management as it is optional and actually only required for KMyMoney to be build on MS-Windows. Removing libgmp wasn&#8217;t an option since RPM wants it for libnettle and apparently libmpir is not working too well with it. Once removed, I rebuild the whole stack of Alkimia, AqBanking, Gwenhywfar and KMyMoney and now online banking is back in full swing.</p> <p>Oh, and so far no problems on the Mesa/Nouveau graphics side of things. I even fired up <a href="https://home.flightgear.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FlightGear</a> and it worked.<br /></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>A week ago Benjamin Port presented our work around KDE Itinerary at <a href="https://2018.capitoledulibre.org/">Capitole de Libre</a> in Toulouse, and Thursday I did the same at the <a href="http://wiki.lafabriquedesmobilites.fr/wiki/Meetup_Open_Transport#Meetup_.2320_du_22_novembre_2018_.C3.A0_19h_Leonard.2C_Paris">Paris Open Transport Meetup</a>. Here&#8217;s some of the feedback we got.</p> <p>First of all, I&#8217;m very happy with the interest we saw in this, it seems people are aware of and care for the privacy issues there and are very eager to use a free software alternative to the proprietary services, that&#8217;s very motivating.</p> <h3 id="more-integration">More Integration</h3> <p>When actually trying the currently existing software many people seem to run into the limited integration with other email clients or workflows we have right now. If you aren&#8217;t using either a KMail / Nextcloud / Davdroid or a KMail / KDE Connect setup you&#8217;ll have a hard time to actually get useful data into the KDE Itinerary app.</p> <p>That doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise, so far the focus has been on demonstrating this can be done at all, not on widespread integration. That however has been kept in mind, the extraction engine is designed as a shared library independent of any KMail specifics to enable this.</p> <p>In particular, the following scenarios have been often requested:</p> <ul> <li>A Thunderbird extraction plugin, similar to what we do in KMail right now.</li> <li>An extraction plugin for <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, to do the extraction automatically on the server side, more similar to how this works with Google.</li> <li>Being able to import all supported data directly into the KDE Itinerary app (this works in theory, but trying to keep the app lightweight and therefore making some of the dependencies for the extractor engine optional turns out to be counter-productive).</li> <li>Integration with Android email clients, possibly via generic sharing mechanism on Android.</li> <li>Support GSConnect alongside KDE Connect.</li> </ul> <p>This all makes sense of course, we could use some help with getting this done though.</p> <h3 id="open-transport">Open Transport</h3> <p>Another interesting thing to learn was that there is an entire community around open data and free software around transportation, beyond just <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. I wasn&#8217;t aware of the extend of this. And obviously there are interesting opportunities for collaboration.</p> <p>The first such collaboration is with <a href="https://navitia.io/">Navitia</a>, for access to schedules and real-time traffic information for public transport networks. This actually has a long history in KDE with the Plasma 4 era <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport">Public Transport</a> applet. That suffered from sustainability issues with supporting a wide range of public transport operators, so it&#8217;s obviously a good idea to share that work with others having the same need. And we certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to duplicate all that again for KDE Itinerary. More on this to come.</p>

        <p>This November was very exciting for me so far, as I was starting a new job at a company called <a href="https://heidolph-instruments.com/en/start">Heidolph</a>. I left <a href="https://www.suse.com">SUSE</a> after working there for another two years. My role there that was pretty far away from interesting technical work, which I missed more and more, so I decided to grab the opportunity to join in a new adventure.</p> <p>Heidolph is a mature German engineering company building premium laboratory equipment. It is based in Schwabach, Germany. For me it is the first time that I am working in company that doesn&#8217;t do only software. At Heidolph, software is just one building block besides mechanical and electronic parts and tons of special know how. That is a very different situation and a lot to learn for me, but in a small, co-located team of great engineers, I am able to catch up fast in this interesting area.</p> <p>We build software for the next generation Heidolph devices based on Linux and C++/Qt. Both technologies are in the center of my interest, over the years it has become more than clear for me that I want to continue with that and deepen my knowledge even more.</p> <p>Since the meaning of open source has changed a lot since I started to contribute to free software and KDE in particular, it was a noticeable but not difficult step for me to take and move away from a self-proclaimed open source company towards a company that is using open source technologies as one part of their tooling and is<br /> interested in learning about the processes we do in open source to build great products. An exciting move for me where I will learn a lot but also benefit from my experience. This of course that does not mean that I will stop to contribute to open source projects.</p> <p>We are still building up the team and look for a <a href="https://heidolphinstrumentsgmbhcokg.softgarden.io/job/2526659?l=de">Software Quality Engineer</a>. If you are interested in working with us in an exciting environment, you might wanna get in touch.</p>

I would however recommend to at least read the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/webgl.html">documentation</a> (<i>the link will point to 5.12 docs after release</i>).</p> <p>WebGL streaming is a <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpa.html">QPA plugin</a> that sends (&#8220;streams&#8221;) OpenGL calls of your Qt Quick application over the network and in turn those are translated into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> calls and thus can be rendered at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML5 Canvas</a>. What it means in practice is that you can have an application running on a remote host and render its GUI in a local web-browser.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s how it looks schematically:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-it-works.png" title="Qt WebGL, how it works" /></p> <p>Here&#8217;s also a <a href="https://youtu.be/X1iDlE06xdA">video</a> from KDE Akademy with a more detailed explanation by <a href="http://blog.qt.io/blog/author/jesusfernandez/">Jesus Fernandez</a>.</p> <p>But since I&#8217;m a simple Qt &#8220;user&#8221;, I don&#8217;t really care about any of that (<i>it&#8217;s all hidden from me anyway</i>), and to me everything looks like this:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-it-works-simplified.png" title="Qt WebGL, how it works, simplified" /></p> <p>So I can have a Qt-based application running on some device and work with it from Safari on my iPad. Sounds alright.</p> <p>Naturally, instead of a device (<i>Raspberry Pi in this case</i>) there could be a desktop computer &#8220;hosting&#8221; the application, but I think WebGL streaming will be used mostly on embedded platforms (<i>see <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/category/loop/feed/#use-cases">use cases</a> section</i>).</p> <p>Let&#8217;s now highlight a couple of points we&#8217;ve just learnt about the feature:</p> <ul> <li>The application itself <b>does not</b> run inside a web-browser. Web-browser <b>only renders</b> its GUI;</li> <li>So it is <b>neither</b> video-streaming, <b>nor</b> mirroring. It is about &#8220;decoupling&#8221; application&#8217;s GUI and showing it in a web-browser;</li> <li>Since it&#8217;s for OpenGL (ES) things only, WebGL streaming does not work with Widgets or any other non-OpenGL stuff.</li> </ul> <p>In fact, if you try to launch some &#8220;non-compatible&#8221; Qt application using WebGL QPA, most likely you&#8217;ll get the following error:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">qt.qpa.webgl: WebGL QPA platform plugin: Raster surfaces are not supported </pre> <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;"><a name="how-to-use-it">How to use it</a></h3> <p>You only need to install it:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/qt-installer-webgl.png" title="Qt WebGL, installation" /></p> <p>&#8230;or, if you are not into installers, build Qt from <a href="http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qt5.git/">sources</a> as usual &#8211; no special configuration options needed. Actually, with earlier versions <code>-opengl es2</code> option was required, but there is no need in that as <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html">Qt Quick Scene Graph</a> can use ES subset even if there is a later version of OpenGL available.</p> <p>Having installed Qt itself, build any Qt Quick application of yours and launch it with the following command line arguments:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">$ ./your-qt-application -platform webgl </pre> <p>Yes, you don&#8217;t need to make any modifications in your source code, it just works. Open the following address in your web-browser: <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>, where <code>127.0.0.1</code> is the IP address of the host running your application.</p> <p>If you want to use a different port, you can specify it like that:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">$ ./your-qt-application -platform webgl:port=8998 </pre> <p>Needless to say, Qt WebGL is cross-platform, and it works equally fine on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. Although, there are some differences in launching applications:</p> <p>Linux:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">./your-qt-application -platform webgl:port=8998 </pre> <p>Mac OS:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">QT_QPA_PLATFORM=webgl:port=8998 ./your-qt-application.app/Contents/MacOS/your-qt-application </pre> <p>&#8230;because Qt version I have at the moment apparently ignores <code>-platform</code> option (<i>which sounds like a bug that needs to be reported</i>).</p> <p>Windows:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">your-qt-application.exe -platform webgl:port=8998 </pre> <p>And of course you can do it in a cross-platform (<i>duh</i>) way via <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtglobal.html#qputenv">qputenv()</a> in your <code>main.cpp</code>:</p> <pre class="brush:cpp">// ... qputenv("QT_QPA_PLATFORM", "webgl:port=8998"); QGuiApplication app(argc, argv); // ... </pre> <p>Speaking about web-browsers support, I tried several ones (<i>except for the one with trident and his younger brother</i>), and it worked in all of them, so it looks like WebGL is well supported in modern browsers nowadays. Although, I did experience a couple of occasional page reloads, and also Chrome on Android tablet even crashed once, so apparently not that well, but that&#8217;s really outside the Qt&#8217;s scope.</p> <p>With regards to performance, the most &#8220;busy&#8221; time is during the initialization phase, when web-browser is receiving buffers, textures, glyphs, atlases and so on. After the first draw call, the bandwidth usage is pretty low. And by the way, since OpenGL ES calls are sent as binary data, it should be more &#8220;light-weight&#8221; than VNC. I am actually thinking about writing another blog-post to compare WebGL streaming and VNC in terms of network utilization.</p> <h3><a name="some-demos">Some demos</a></h3> <p>There is already a fair amount of demo videos in previous blog-posts, and here&#8217;s also another nice <a href="https://youtu.be/C4KSfQ3XFC8">compilation</a>, so I decided to create a couple of my own.</p> <h4><a name="demo-device-information">Device Information</a></h4> <p>This one is a rather simple demo application. It gathers some information about the platform it is running on. For example, here&#8217;s what it shows when I run it on my Mac:</p> <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><div class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><![endif]--> <video autoplay="1" class="wp-video-shortcode" controls="controls" height="360" id="video-52932-1" loop="1" width="640"><source src="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/di.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4"><a href="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/di.mp4">https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/di.mp4</a></video></div><br /> If video doesn&#8217;t play in your browser, you can download it <a href="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/di.mp4">here</a></div> <p>Let&#8217;s now run it on Raspberry Pi using WebGL streaming plugin, connect to it from a web-browser on the same Mac and ascertain that it no longer reports Mac OS as operating system and that platform is <b>webgl</b> now. There is one more thing to see here &#8211; pay attention to changing values of the &#8220;screen&#8221; resolution:</p> <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><div class="wp-video"><video class="aligncenter" controls="controls" height="360" id="video-52932-2" loop="1" width="640"><source src="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/webgl-different-canvas-sizes.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4"><a href="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/webgl-different-canvas-sizes.mp4">https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/webgl-different-canvas-sizes.mp4</a></video></div><br /> If video doesn&#8217;t play in your browser, you can download it <a href="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/raw/master/webgl-release-blog/img/webgl-different-canvas-sizes.mp4">here</a></div> <p>As you can see, when I resize the browser window, application (<i>beside nicely adapting its layout</i>) reports changed screen resolution values. This is because it takes canvas dimensions for the screen resolution. Let&#8217;s check that in web-browser inspector:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/webgl-canvas-equals-screen.png" title="Qt WebGL, canvas equals screen" /></p> <p>By the way, we can take a look at user input events here as well:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/webgl-js-events.png" title="Qt WebGL, JS events" /></p> <p>So application does indeed run on Raspberry, and what I have in my browser is just its &#8220;streamed&#8221; GUI.</p> <h4><a name="demo-camera">Camera</a></h4> <p>This demo is a bit more practical one &#8211; it&#8217;s a camera controlled by robotic-ish arm which is mounted on a Raspberry Pi device:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rpi-camera-pimoroni-hat.jpg" title="Raspberry Pi with camera and Pimoroni pan-tilt HAT" /></p> <p>The idea is to control the camera (its pan and tilt) with a Qt-based application running on the device, but to do that remotely from a web-browser on some tablet. And of course we would like to see what cameras is looking at (<i>its viewfinder</i>). And it also would be nice to make photos with the camera.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s a list of required hardware for such a setup:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://thepihut.com/products/pan-tilt-hat">Pan-Tilt HAT</a>;</li> <li><a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</a>. I could choose RPi Zero as well, but this HAT fits better on a &#8220;full-sized&#8221; RPi;</li> <li><a href="https://thepihut.com/products/pibow-3b-coupe-raspberry-pi-3-3b">Pibow 3B+ Coupe Royale</a>;</li> <li><a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module">Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2</a>.</li> </ul> <p>And that&#8217;s <a href="https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/assembling-pan-tilt-hat">the manual</a> I used to assemble it.</p> <p>Now let&#8217;s take a little detour (<i>spoiler: I will be promoting Qt&#8217;s commercial features</i>). You might have noticed that for <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/category/loop/feed/#demo-device-information">Device Information</a> demo I used <a href="https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation/qtb2-index.html">Boot to Qt</a> image, saving myself quite some time and efforts with regards to building Qt-based application for Raspberry Pi and deploying it there.</p> <p>But Boot to Qt is a commercial-only feature, and without it you&#8217;ll have to go though some more steps setting up system environment. Here&#8217;s what it takes with a regular <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Stretch Lite</a> image as an example:</p> <ul> <li>Since Qt Multimedia module is used, you need to make sure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer">GStreamer</a> is installed in the system and you have correct plugins available;</li> <li>Get the latest Qt build (5.12) for Raspberry Pi. Either set a cross-compilation toolchain on your desktop or build it right on the device. Building Qt from sources directly on Raspberry Pi is actually a viable option (<i>especially if you failed with cross-compilation toolchain</i>), although compilation itself takes around 10 hours and requires some dances with increasing available swap size (<i>1 GB of RAM is really not enough</i>);</li> <li>Build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video4Linux">V4L</a> driver to make camera discoverable by GStreamer and thus Qt;</li> <li>Come up with a convenient way of building/deploying your applications on device.</li> </ul> <p>Even though this list of steps is not too long, in practice it can take you up to several days before you get a working setup, whether with Boot to Qt image you get everything working out-of-the-box, and you can run your applications on the connected device right from the Qt Creator. But enough with the promotional part, let&#8217;s get back to demo.</p> <p>The GUI layout looks like the following:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/webgl-release-mac-camera.png" title="Qt Multimedia, camera demo application, viewfinder" /></p> <p>Most of the space on the first tab is taken by the camera&#8217;s viewfinder, which is implemented with <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtmultimedia-videooutput.html">VideoOutput</a> and <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtmultimedia-camera.html">Camera</a> itself:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">Camera { id: camera } VideoOutput { anchors.fill: parent fillMode: VideoOutput.PreserveAspectCrop source: camera } </pre> <p>There are two <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.11/qml-qtquick-controls2-slider.html">sliders</a>, horizontal and vertical &#8211; for controlling pan and tilt of the camera:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">Slider { id: sliderTilt orientation: Qt.Vertical from: root.maxValue value: 0 stepSize: 1 to: -root.maxValue onPressedChanged: { if (!pressed) { backend.movePanTilt(basePath, sliderPan.value, sliderTilt.value) } } } </pre> <p>Pan-Tilt HAT servos are interfaced via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I&#178;C">I2C</a>, and due to the lack of time I went with fast and dirty solution &#8211; by using Pimoroni&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/pantilt-hat">Python library</a>. At some point I would like to do it properly with C/C++, although it&#8217;s really not the point of the demo.</p> <p>There is also a <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-controls2-button.html">button</a> for taking photos using <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtmultimedia-cameracapture.html">CameraCapture</a>:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">Button { scale: hovered ? (pressed ? 0.9 : 1.1) : 1 background: Rectangle { color: "transparent" } Image { anchors.fill: parent source: "/img/camera.png" } onClicked: { camera.imageCapture.captureToLocation(basePath + "shots/" + getCurrentDateTime() + ".jpg"); } } </pre> <p>Second tab contains a list of taken photos:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://qt-blog-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/webgl-release-mac-photos.png" title="Qt Multimedia, camera demo application, photos" /></p> <p>&#8230;which is implemented by <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qt-labs-folderlistmodel-folderlistmodel.html">FolderListModel</a>:</p> <pre class="brush:bash">ListView { FolderListModel { folder: "file:" + basePath + "shots/" nameFilters: ["*.jpg"] } model: folderModel delegate: ItemDelegate { text: model.fileName } } </pre> <p>Full application source code is available <a href="https://git.qt.io/arsidyak/webgl-release/tree/master/webgl-release-demo">here</a>.</p> <p>Now let&#8217;s see it in action. There are 3 spirits placed on my table, surrounding the camera, and I want to take photos of each. I built and ran the application on device with <code>-platform webgl</code>, and connected to it over Wi-Fi from Safari on my iPad:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" height="506" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7MhMZ3qMQNI?feature=oembed" width="900"></iframe></p> <p>As you can see, the plan worked out just fine: seeing camera&#8217;s viewfinder, I can remotely control its position and take photos of the objects I&#8217;m interested in.</p> <h3><a name="use-cases">Use cases</a></h3> <p>Most obvious use case for WebGL streaming is the ability to have a decent GUI for some low-end device with limited computing power, without GPU, and quite often without any display at all. For instance, that is a common scenario for industrial automation domain, where you can have lots of headless devices installed all over the factory: they can be distributed over quite a significant area or even mounted in places with hazardous environment &#8211; being able to control/configure those remotely comes to be rather handy.</p> <p>Reading discussion at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14718043">Hacker News</a>, I stumbled upon a &#8220;reverse&#8221; idea: what if it&#8217;s the other way around, what if &#8220;device&#8221; is actually a very powerful server, and you work with it from your regular desktop. That way you can can perform some heavy calculations on the server while having GUI in your web-browser (<i>which actually begs for an HTML-based frontend but more on this in the <a href="https://blog.qt.io/blog/category/loop/feed/#webgl-streaming-vs-actual-web">next section</a></i>).</p> <p>Another possible use-case is an anti-piracy measure. Let&#8217;s say you want to protect your software from being &#8220;cracked&#8221; or &#8220;pirated&#8221;. Obviously, if there is nothing running on the client, then there is nothing to crack as your users only have GUI rendered in their browsers, and the application itself is running on your server. Sounds interesting, but there are several drawbacks here:</p> <ul> <li>While WebGL streaming performs well in local network, using it over the internet will result in significant latency;</li> <li>Connection is not encrypted, so it is not secure;</li> <li>Currently only one connection at a time is supported (<i>so only one user</i>).</li> </ul> <p>Overall, supporting only one connection at a time fairly reduces the number of possible use cases, and unfortunately it is unlikely that current implementation of the feature will improve in that regard, so it is more of a task for <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-62425">Qt 6</a>. By the way, there is an idea to complement streaming with an ability of mirroring as in some cases having the latter is more important.</p> <p>Speaking about mirroring, I would like to mention our recent <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/remote-ui-with-qt-for-automation-on-arm-based-edge-devices-1539882056/">webinar</a> that we had together with Toradex. There you can see an interesting combination of WebGL streaming and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtremoteobjects-index.html">Remote Objects</a>, which allows you to implement mirroring functionality as of now already.</p> <p>Another noticeable aspect of WebGL streaming is so-called &#8220;zero install&#8221; concept &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to install/deploy anything on clients (<i>desktops/tablets/smartphones/etc</i>) as the only thing needed is just a web-browser. However, <a href="http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/11/19/getting-started-qt-webassembly/">Qt for WebAssembly</a> seems to be a bit more suitable for that purpose.</p> <h4><a name="webgl-streaming-vs-actual-web">WebGL streaming vs actual web</a></h4> <p>Some of you might ask, what is the point of relying on WebGL streaming in the first place? Since it&#8217;s all about web-browser, one can just take a regular web-server and create a web-application &#8211; result will be almost the same: backend is hosted on the remote device and HTML-based GUI is rendered in the web-browser.</p> <p>That is a very good and fair question. I actually have some experience in web-development, so I asked this question myself. Let&#8217;s try to answer it, hopefully without starting yet another holy war.</p> <p>Indeed, in some cases it is enough just to have a simple REST API, especially if you only need to get some plain text data values. So it is likely that Qt-based application with WebGL streaming would be an overkill for such purpose.</p> <p>However, in more sophisticated scenarios (<i>for example, when you need to control some hardware</i>) Qt-based application with WebGL-streamed GUI might fit better, because that way you&#8217;ll get a powerful backend (<i>C++/Qt</i>), and I would also mention that creating a complex, appealing and performant frontend is (<i>considerably</i>) easier with Qt Quick rather than with HTML/CSS/JS, but this statement does look like a beginning of yet another holy war, so I&#8217;ll keep that as my personal opinion.</p> <p>And the last thing worth to mention here &#8211; if you already have a Qt-based application, then WebGL streaming is an obvious option, because it will cost you nothing to have a remote GUI for it.</p> <h3><a name="licensing-pricing">Licensing/pricing</a></h3> <p>WebGL streaming plugin is available under commercial and Open Source licenses (<i>but GPLv3 only</i>). And for commercial customers it is included in both Application Development and Device Creation products with no additional charge.</p> <h3><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3> <p>So you&#8217;re now able to use web-browser as a remote GUI client for your Qt Quick applications with no efforts &#8211; it only takes one command line parameter.</p> <p>In terms of further development, I reckon the next thing to be expected is connection security/encryption, both for WebSocket and WebServer. WebSocket part should be pretty straightforward as <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebsocket.html">QWebSocket</a> already supports secure connection (<code>wss://</code>). And WebServer part, if you remember, from the very beginning was a temporary solution, and research on proper implementation (<i>including support for HTTPS</i>) is still ongoing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you have any other feature-requests or maybe bugs to report, please use our tracker for that: <a href="http://bugreports.qt.io/">http://bugreports.qt.io/</a> (<i>choose <b>QPA: WebGL</b> component</i>).

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi, all. I worked on the recent migration of <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org/">AcousticBrainz</a> to the central Hetzner infrastructure that hosts all our other projects. It was a fun experience that I would like to share on this blog.</p>
<p>This was the first time I worked with a production database of this scale, and it was a real learning experience. It really felt like I had jumped off the deep end, but it was really fun!</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, AcousticBrainz is a music technology project which crowd sources acoustic information for music recordings and is a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.mtg.upf.edu/">Music Technology Group</a> at <a href="http://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> and <a href="https://metabrainz.org/">MetaBrainz</a>. AcousticBrainz has already collected information about 3.7 million unique recordings and has individual submissions from users for over 11 million recordings.</p>
<p>All the data is stored in a single PostgreSQL database for now. The server that AcousticBrainz used to run on (we called it spike, after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_and_Tyke_(characters)">Tom and Jerry character</a>) had gotten old and started spitting out hard disk failure warnings, so we decided to move it to the central Hetzner infrastructure where other MetaBrainz projects are hosted.</p>
<p>We use Docker for all services running in Hetzner and it has worked pretty well for us so far. So the first task was <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pull/286">creating a production Docker environment</a> for AcousticBrainz. Consul is used to provide configuration values for the AcousticBrainz server which needed some <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pull/284">new code and consul template files</a> to be written. This is relatively simple stuff that did not take too long. We also have a repository to store all configuration values and scripts that need to be run on each of our servers. So I also wrote code to run the three different services that AcousticBrainz needs in different Docker containers.</p>
<p>After that, I started work on creating data dumps of the AcousticBrainz data. There was already some code that dumped the entire database into an lzma compressed file. However, it was old code that hadn&#8217;t been run in a long time and the database had gotten biiig since then. The way the code worked was that it dumped each table as a file into a directory and then added the entire directory at once into a tar file. However, this approach doesn&#8217;t work now, because the table that stores the low‐level JSON data that users submit to us has become too big to be stored in a single text file uncompressed. The <code>lowlevel_json</code> file has 11 million rows right now with each row containing a relatively large JSON document stored in a column of Postgres&#8217; cool JSONB type. The table takes around 357 GB when stored inside Postgres and this balloons to much over the space we had on spike. So, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pull/293">some code</a> that dumped 500,000 rows into a file and compressed it before dumping the next 500,000 rows.</p>
<p>The compressed AcousticBrainz data dump was around 169 GB in size which seemed reasonable. Then, I realized that the server we were planning to run the webserver on (called boingo, after <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/166bc1cb-a2b7-412d-bcd5-5f439d2cf5f1">Oingo Boingo</a>) did not have enough storage space or computational power to hold and work with the database. This led to us getting a new shiny server called frank (after <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/e520459c-dff4-491d-a6e4-c97be35e0044">Frank Ocean</a>!) which has a pretty big 7200 RPM hard disk and over a 100 GB of RAM. We also decided to upgrade to PostgreSQL 10 during the migration, which led me to creating <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/docker-postgres/pull/5">a Docker image for PostgreSQL 10</a> that we could use in production.</p>
<p>After this, I imported the data into the empty Postgres server which worked pretty well. Everything seemed set for a small downtime for migration where we&#8217;d just create a small incremental data dump, move it to frank and import, bring spike down, bring the webserver up on frank and be done with it. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwbKrjqYyId9LaxTs8I3kWXOwDRBm6-eae5NL1uXSrk/edit?usp=sharing">The steps were written up</a> and we were ready to go.</p>
<p>Things started, I brought the site down on spike, created an incremental dump, imported it to frank. Everything worked. We decided to do a integrity check of the new database once before bringing the new site up. This is where the trouble started. The number of rows in one of the the tables was 10 million when it should have been around a 100M, yikes. We realized that there had been a bug in the original data dump code that<br />
we&#8217;d written. It was a pretty small bug, the key we were using to dump the data was incorrect. <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pull/305/files#diff-37702c3ba98fe2366f5df112d1112570R380">One line fix.</a> I thought that we need more tests for our data dumps code.</p>
<p>Well, at that point we decided to just go ahead and dump and import the table individually instead of stopping the whole process. The downtime was much longer than expected because of this, the table was pretty big, 100 million rows is no joke, it took <code>pg_dump</code> hours to dump it. Then, I dropped the table on frank and began an import of the dumped file. We had decided to not drop constraints before importing for sanity reasons, but that turned out to not be that good of an idea. It took the import 5–6 hours before it was even halfway done and the time to import new rows was increasing. We gave up, stopped the import and dropped all constraints before starting a new clean import. This worked much much faster and was done in around an hour. At that point, we did another sanity check of the database, before bringing the site back up.</p>
<p>Some static files like binaries and old dumps we linked to were still hosted on spike (another thing I missed!), so I had to whip up a quick pull request changing links temporarily. I was doing this at 3 in the morning and I had started working on this the previous day 11 in the morning. It was the longest, most intense production deployment I have ever done. Pretty fun—now that I think about it—but I was tired then.</p>
<p>Later, I set up an <a href="http://ftp.acousticbrainz.org">FTP server on frank</a> and moved the static files we were hosting there.</p>
<p>There were a lot of things that I learned in this entire process. First thing was that we should really sanity check literally everything before bringing any production service down. Second thing was that importing data with constraints in a database (especially for large amounts of data) is not very feasible. Third is that this level of control is not something that I would ever get as a new grad in any big company. Being thrown off the deep end here at MetaBrainz was really awesome. Another thing that I forgot to mention was that the entire migration process was done remotely over IRC with me sitting in college in <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/area/499854c2-a8e3-4f52-b577-bf1088b15517">Hamirpur, India</a> and my teammates in <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/area/12c3b82e-fcab-4219-9bd5-792089d8280e">Barcelona</a>. This really teaches efficient communication and teamwork.</p>
<p>In hindsight, there are a few things that I&#8217;d do differently given the chance again. I&#8217;d definitely have sanity checked the imported database before actually going through with the downtime. It would have saved a lot of pain and the downtime would have been much lower. This is the biggest thing I learned from the migration process. Sanity check as often as possible.</p>
<p>All in all, working with production grade big data projects has been pretty awesome, and I hope I continue to learn as much as possible as early as possible.</p>

        <p>For my hacking, I love to use the <a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop</a> IDE. Once in a while, I find myself working on a project that has different indentation styles depending on the filetype &#8212; in this case, C++ files, Makefiles, etc. use tabs, JavaScript and HTML files use 2 spaces. I haven&#8217;t found this to be straight-forward from KDevelop&#8217;s configuration dialog (though I just learnt that it does seem to be possible). I did find myself having to fix indentation before committing (annoying!) and even having to fix up the indentation of code committed by myself (embarrassing!). As that&#8217;s both stupid and repetitive work, it&#8217;s something I wanted to avoid. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done using <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">EditorConfig</a> files:</p> <ol> <li>put a file called <code>.editorconfig</code> in the project&#8217;s root directory</li> <li>specify a default style and then a specialization for certain filetypes</li> <li>restart KDevelop</li> </ol> <p>Here&#8217;s what my .editorconfig file looks like:</p> <pre><code> # EditorConfig is awesome: https://EditorConfig.org # for the top-most EditorConfig file, set... # root = true # In general, tabs shown 2 spaces wide [*] indent_style = tab indent_size = 2 # Matches multiple files with brace expansion notation [*.{js,html}] indent_style = space indent_size = 2 </code></pre> <p>This does the job nicely and has the following advantages:</p> <ul> <li>It doesn&#8217;t affect my other projects, so I don&#8217;t have to run around in the configuration to switch when task-switching. (Editorconfigs cascade, so will be looked up up in the filesystem tree for fallback styles.</li> <li>It works across different editors supporting the editorconfig standards, so not just KWrite, Kate, KDevelop, but also for <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">entirely different products</a>.</li> <li>It allows me to spend less time on formalities and more time on actual coding (or diving).</li> </ul> <p>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/9zjmh8/kate_how_to_make_it_indent_py_with_spaces_and/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.)</p>

<span id="more-6660"></span>

<h1>Retrospective topics</h1>

<h2>Unannounced changes to core packages</h2>

<p>This is primarily related to dnf. The dnf maintainers did not file a Change proposal for Fedora 29. However, some significant changes were made to the dnf package through the course of the development cycle. Some of these changes were made to support modularity and are ultimately beneficial to Fedora, however it resulted in late destabilization and several blocker bugs. Prior to the release, the FPL, FPgM, and dnf team met to discuss the issue. They had already begun doing bugfix-only instead of rebasing to new releases. This should not be an issue in future releases.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Go&#8221; decision despite bugs with updates</h2>

<p>Several bugs proposed as blockers were not accepted because they could not be reproduced or did not violate release criteria. Most notable was a bug (<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1642796">BZ 1642796</a>) where Gnome Software was stuck at 97% during an upgrade. This was later identified to be caused by having multilib libraries installed. František Zatloukal will propose a change to the release criteria that would require testing multilib installs, as this is expected to be a common use case.<br></p>

<h2>Missing spins at release time</h2>

<p>Some of the Fedora Spins and Labs were not included in the compose that was declared gold. With a few notable exceptions, Spins intentionally do not block releases. However, from a user-friendliness standpoint, it is nice to have all of the Spins available. Some of the missing Spins failed to build due to broken packages, while others (e.g. the ppc64le Cloud image) happened to have a transient failure during the compose that eventually shipped.<br></p>

<p>We identified two separate avenues to address this issue. The first is raising the visibility of failed Spin builds prior to the release so that Spin maintainers have time to address this issue. František Zatloukal suggested having a member of the Spins SIG track Release Engineering Pague issues to that they will see build failures and can notify the appropriate Spin owner(s). However, the Spins SIG may not be active enough to support this.<br></p>

<p>The second is decoupling Spins from the main release process such that they can be published in a more-self service manner. This may take the form of Spin maintainers marking their spin “Go” or of providing a self-service build and publishing system for non-blocking deliverables.<br></p>

<p>In subsequent discussion with Release Engineering, we determined that the Fedora Program Manager will send a list of failing Spins and Labs to owners at the Freeze points for Fedora 30. Work to provide an automated notification system based on Pungi notifications will be considered for Fedora 31 and beyond. Similarly, Release Engineering is already planning how a self-service platform might be developed for Fedora 31.<br></p>

<h2>SELinux denials the first few days after install</h2>

<p>Visible SELinux denials violate the release criteria. No denials were observed during pre-release testing, however some community members observed it after release. The SELinux troubleshooting applet is no longer a part of the default Workstation install, which means the release criteria no longer match reality. Julen Landa Alustiza is going to propose a modification to the release criteria to reflect the new state — either to drop the SELinux denial criterion or to update it to match the default Workstation configuration.<br></p>

<h2>Cisco openh264 repo</h2>

<p>Updated openh264 packages provided to Cisco were not available on Cisco’s repo when Fedora 29 was released. This meant the packages could not be installed or updated initially. Release Engineering worked with Cisco to resolve the issue. For future releases, Release Engineering will verify that the packages are available before updating the repodata in Fedora’s repos.</p>

<h1>Meta retrospective</h1>

<p>The discussion was hindered by difficulties with the Jitsi conference. Not all participants were audible to all other participants. We eventually moved the conversation to IRC, where I had been logging notes. In the future, we may use BlueJeans or another conference platform.<br></p>

<p>In addition, we had several topics suggested by members of the community. In the future, it would help for the Program Manager to collect topics with some details during the weeks leading up to the release. This advanced preparedness would allow more time for the community to see some of the topics and ensure that relevant participants can be explicitly invited.</p>

        <p>My journey from Python to Golang via Node.js</p><p>Ever since college, I dabbled with Python, made a few scripts here and there, built some websites with Flask and Django. It was the first language I referred to anyone because it was quite easy to start with and delivers amazing results to the developers in no time. Although it was quite a break from having to program in C and Java, the language felt lacking in some of the most important areas.</p><h3>The deal breaker</h3><p>Now came Node.js into my life and I began experimenting with concurrency patterns. Backend JavaScript? Who would take that seriously? At best, it seemed like a new attempt to make server-side development easier at the cost of performance, scalability, etc. Maybe it’s just my ingrained developer skepticism, but there’s always been that alarm that goes off in my brain when I read about something being fast and easy and production-level.</p><p>Node.js became my go to language for a very long time. I got used to the latest programming syntaxes with using ES7 in the client side of things. The single threaded node event-loop made miracles possible for me, without severing any kind of performance and being cheap to use. As time passed, I began a deeper dive into the world of npm modules and the architecture of Node.js. It is a magical space filled with unicorns and rainbows.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*In5xU4obN2qlDEMAyPwg_w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Performance at it’s best?</figcaption></figure><p>Most developers have heard about Node’s non-blocking I/O model; it’s great because it means all requests are handled asynchronously without blocking execution, or incurring any overhead (like with threads and processes) and as the developer you can be blissfully unaware what’s happening in the backend. However, it’s always important to keep in mind that Node is single-threaded which means none of your code runs in parallel. I/O may not block the server but your code certainly does. If you call sleep for 5 seconds, your server will be unresponsive during that time. But my actual problem came with JavaScript. I know most of you will feel this like a rant and there are ways to solve this problem. Please, just bear with me through this.</p><p>When people were developing JavaScript, they wanted it to do all sorts of things and serve every other purpose. It all started with those thoughts, which made it kind of messy. Determining boolean outcomes in plain old JavaScript is hard.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TdKBZcFORJk1sMuKmELNTw.jpeg" /><figcaption>True? False? Confused all in all.</figcaption></figure><pre>// all true</pre><pre>1 == '1';<br />1 == [1];<br />'1' == [1];</pre><pre>// all false</pre><pre>1 === '1';<br />1 === [1];<br />'1' === [1];</pre><p>The internal type system of JavaScript is a mixed bag with six different types which causes all sorts of havoc to the end user.</p><ul><li>Undefined (a variable with no defined value)</li><li>Null (a single null value)</li><li>Boolean (true or false)</li><li>Number (this includes Infinity and NaN – not a number!)</li><li>String (textual data)</li><li>Symbol (a unique and immutable primitive new to ES6/2015)</li></ul><p>I know there are ways to sort out these issues effectively, but a language experiencing these sorts of mutability can be problematic to users who are new to JavaScript world.</p><p>Then comes callback hell and having to deal with Promises and all in all the new keywords async and await . I always had retrospection over my language choices and it became very clear that I need strong typing and I can’t live without it. I tried TypeScript but it seemed a bit too expressive to start with.</p><h3>The Second Deal Breaker</h3><p>My main requirements for a language were speed, reliability, built-in concurrency patterns, a strong type system, garbage collection and lots of tooling. It’s not until recent times that I felt the need for all this stuff. I heard rumours earlier about Google building a new language that is going to change the world. True to the naming, it really brought about some deal breaking changes. Here’s a list of things I like about Go and why you’ll love it too.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L3wZZlN4wBjuF-W1vLfhCw.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>go get -u programmer.life/success</strong></figcaption></figure><h4>Opinionated</h4><p>Yes, it is very opinionated. But, I love the way of doing things in one way. With Golang, to do something, there’s just one way of doing it. The official tooling built around Go ensures that we do follow the one way.</p><h4>Goroutines</h4><p>The first half of Go’s concurrency paradigms. Lightweight, concurrent function execution. You can spawn tons of these if needed and the Go runtime multiplexes them onto the configured number of CPUs/Threads as needed. They start with a super small stack that can grow (and shrink) via dynamic allocation (and freeing). They are as simple as go f(x), where f() is a function.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_c9Ob50Cdmh09wLSzHRKgQ.png" /><figcaption>I am strong. Because I do workouts concurrently 🔥</figcaption></figure><h4>Channels</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/425/1*H2Qh0oiHP64TkG4-Nnjtng.png" /></figure><p>The other half of Go’s concurrency story. Channels are a typed conduit used to send and receive values. These are used to pass values to and from Goroutines for processing. They are by default unbuffered, meaning synchronous and blocking. They can also be buffered, allowing values to queue up inside of them for processing. Multiple go routines can read/write to them at the same time without having to take locks. Go also has primitives for reading from multiple channels simultaneously via the select statement.</p><h4>Compiled Static Binaries</h4><p>Go compiles your program into a <strong>static binary</strong>. Yep, you heard it right. A <strong>static binary</strong>. This makes deployment really simple. Just copy the binary and it should be good to go. No pip install, no virtualenv, no freaking npm install . All of that is handled at compile time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*BES005dHRZzV4WBtA7XV7Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>Binaries defeat all!</figcaption></figure><h4>Cross Compilation</h4><p>This is too good to be true. But it is. Yes. Golang allows cross compilation. Ever wanted to test your program on Windows but you use Linux? No more installing compilation tools and building it again on windows. Simply, use GOOS=windows and you can compile it on a Mac or a Linux machine. It even allows changing the architecture of the platform with GOARCH . There’s a laundry list of available platforms and OSes. You can find the list <a href="https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63">here</a>.</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go is a complied language, but still has a runtime. It handles all of the details of mallocing memory for you, allocating/deallocating space for variables, etc. Memory used by variables lasts as long as the variables are referenced, which is usually the scope of a function. Go has a garbage collector.</p><h4>Pass by Value</h4><p>“For the love of all holy Mary, please don’t bring back pointers.” And, well, yeah, they almost averted the crisis in the case of Golang. Everything is passed by value, but there are pointers. It’s just that the value of a pointer is a memory location, so it acts as pass by reference. This means that, by default, there is no shared state between functions. But, you can pass a pointer if you desire/need it for performance/memory utilization reasons. Go does the right thing by default, but doesn’t shackle you. Oh, and there isn’t any pointer math, so you won’t screw yourself with it. As pointed out on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5196498">HN</a>, you can do pointer math with the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/">“unsafe”</a> package and unsafe.Pointer.</p><h4>Type System</h4><p>Go has structs and interfaces. Go’s structs can have methods <em>associated</em> with them. Structs can be anonymously included in other structs to make the inside struct’s variables/methods available as part of the enclosting struct. Interfaces are sets of method signatures. Structs implement an interface by implementing the methods described by the interface definition. Functions can receive values by interface, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/KfKLiAClQE">so</a>. The compiler checks all of this at compile time.</p><h4>Package System</h4><p>Or lack there of. Since Go compiles everything statically, you don’t have to worry about packages at runtime. But how do you include libraries into your code? Simply by importing them via url, like so: import "github.com/bmizerany/pq". Go’s tooling knows how to look that up and clone the repo. Also works with Mercurial, Bazaar &amp; Subversion. go get it, my boy.</p><h4>Anon. Functions &amp; Closures</h4><p>Go supports anonymous functions that can form closures. These functions can then be passed around and retain the environment under which they were created, like <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/4rYrqw4l7m">so</a>. This can be super powerful when <a href="https://github.com/freeformz/filechan">combined</a> with channels and go routines.</p><h4>Built in profiling</h4><p>It supports pprof as a part of the standard library. And with a <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">very small bit of work</a>, you can access profiling info via a http interface.</p><h4>Defer</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/340/1*9IyFa5ur0nALjTmnACHkGQ.png" /><figcaption>I love to postpone work, yeah.</figcaption></figure><p>Ever forget to close a file descriptor or free some memory? So have the designers of Go. The reason for this is that you usually have to perform those actions far away from where the resources were opened/allocated. Go solves this problem with the defer statement. Each defer statement pushes a function/expression onto a stack that get’s executed in LIFO order after the enclosing function returns. This makes cleanup really easy, after opened a file, just defer file.Close().</p><h4>Comprehensive Standard Library</h4><p>Go’s <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/">standard library</a> is pretty comprehensive.</p><h4>It’s Fast</h4><p>Go compiles down to native code and it does it fast. Usually in just a few seconds. No matter if you have a million package imports. It does compile in seconds. There’s a rumour that Golang actually came to life over a discussion developers had during a <em>code compilation</em> break.</p><h4>Comprehensive Tooling Out Of The Box</h4><p>Go do a go --help. Some of my favorites: go fmt, go doc, go fix go get go tool pprof&amp; go test.</p><h4>Straight Forward Testing</h4><p>Super <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/testing/">straight foward</a>, no magic. And hell, yeah, it even has a <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">race detector</a> that finds out all your runtime woes even before hitting production.</p><h4>Simple C Interface</h4><p>By using build directives you can integrate with C libraries really <a href="https://gist.github.com/freeformz/4552031">easily</a>.</p><h4>Straight Forward Syntax / Standard Formatting</h4><p>The syntax is pretty simple, C like w/o all the crazy of C. But what’s really nice is go fmt, which re-writes your code into the Go standard format. No more arguments like tabs vs spaces or indentation rules! There’s just one way and you have to stick to it my friend.</p><h3>Golang’s Cons</h3><p>With all of that said, it’s not perfect…</p><h4>Runtime</h4><p>Go’s runtime is not super <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_does_Go_perform_badly_on_benchmark_x">tuned</a> yet. By comparison the JVM has had over 18 years of development history behind it. But, for a 1.0.X runtime &amp; language, Go is pretty damn good.</p><h4>Garbage Collector</h4><p>Go programs can malloc a lot of ram at times, even when the program itself isn’t using much. Most of this shows up as VIRT though, so most linux systems just won’t care.</p><h4>1 CPU by default</h4><p>This is going to change over time, but the runtime will, by default, use only <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_no_multi_CPU">one CPU</a>.</p><p>I can bear with having a few cons. After all nothing is perfect in this world. I can live by knowing that there are a few disadvantages while using a language as long as they don’t affect programming like JavaScript’s falsity or callback hell.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=681a70f3bc79" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/the-gopher-way-681a70f3bc79">The Gopher way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here’s why.</h1></a>
      <h5>2018-11-19T17:14:54.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Hugues Plessis</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>This may come as a surprise, but copyrighted works often cannot be used in educational and research materials.</p>
<p>For example:  students in France, Italy, Luxembourg and Romania cannot legally quote an entire artwork in a digital presentation. In Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom a teacher may not send an email to her students with excerpts of reading materials. In Denmark, Finland, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom an educator in a nonprofit cannot legally show parts of a video from a DVD they own in a free history class. (You can read more about this in a recent <a href="https://rightcopyright.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/15casesin15countries_FinalReport.pdf">COMMUNIA report</a>.)</p>
<p>These situations only exist because of the lack of harmonized rules in the international copyright framework administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In countries where exceptions and limitations for educational and research uses are in place, they are of various effectiveness—from the flexible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a> doctrine in the US and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing">fair dealing</a> in the UK, Australia and Canada, to <a href="https://www.communia-association.org/2017/05/08/copyright-and-education-in-europe-15-everyday-cases-in-15-countries/">disparate narrow exceptions</a> in the European Union. Alas, many laws in the developing world simply fail to provide the freedom necessary for people to create and use relevant material.</p>
<h3>The current patchwork of exceptions and limitations for educational and research activities</h3>
<p>International talks about common exceptions and limitations are currently stalled by the backpaddling of rightholders and the European Union. The proposed treaty—presented during the Fifth Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest—seeks to advance this process and remedy the patchwork of rules. The text provides for mandatory minimum standards of exceptions and limitations to copyright for online and offline teaching, learning, researching and creating educational materials. With it, individuals and entities will be able to copy protected work in educational materials, quote it in research papers or assignments, mine text and data and more.</p>
<h3>A text that will greatly benefit the Wikimedia community…</h3>
<p>The Wikimedia projects are used by millions as tools to explore, learn and have fun. The proposed treaty will allow our communities to use copyrighted images, short and longer excerpts, in the course of creating material for educational and research purposes, including copying; distributing; translating; illustrating; adapting or altering the works; hosting it; comment and critique it. This will, without a doubt, facilitate inputs in some of our projects like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.</p>
<p>True to our vision of open knowledge and free culture, the proposed treaty is a step in the right direction of creating a flexible fair use exception for research and educational activities in all member states. The common standards introduced in the text as well as its interpretation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_three-step_test">Berne three-step test</a> to satisfy educational and research needs, will together provide a solid basis for member states to enact meaningful exceptions and limitations. The proposed treaty is supporting a current welcomed trend in some countries, like <a href="https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/4-case-fair-use-australia/proposed-fair-use-exception">Australia</a>, that are thinking about transitioning to fair use.</p>
<p>Fair use is a necessary baseline for our projects to be streamlined and the proposed treaty is a first step in this direction. While there are generous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content">non-free exceptions</a> in place for the English Wikipedia concerning non-free content, but exceptions in other language wikis range <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Non-free_content">from more generous than US fair use to non existent</a>. While the Philippine Wikipedia has essentially the same exceptions as English Wikipedia but with looser fair use interpretations in certain circumstances, the Dutch Wikipedia does not allow non-free content at all. Italian Wikipedia benefits from a similar standard as English Wikipedia but not for living people. Finally, the Hungarian Wikipedia allows fair use for “non-conventional” work types only (e.g. screenshots), never photos or paintings. Our language-specific guidelines are effective because each of them is carefully drafted by our communities to make sure that content can legally be used by the people speaking that language. However, the overall disharmony of laws ultimately leads to confusion and may expose Wikipedians and users to liability. The proposed treaty is not the be-all-end-all answer to these challenges, but it paves the way for future evolutions of the law.</p>
<p>The proposed treaty also supports our mission to provide knowledge for all by introducing a reciprocity principle applying to cross border sharing of educational materials. In essence, once materials have been created pursuant to the exceptions in a WIPO member state, they may be distributed or made available in another member state.</p>
<h3>… And the public as a whole</h3>
<p>The proposed treaty adds to the international legal system binding norms that focus on the purpose of the use, rather than the types of individuals or institutions responsible for the use. Therefore, as long as the copyrighted work is included in materials for educational or research purpose, everyone—without distinction—will be able to create, use, mix and share it without barriers. In addition, the new fair use-like exceptions and limitations will undoubtedly support research and educational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">innovative projects</a>.</p>
<p>The text also protects teachers, learners and research institutions from direct and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributory_copyright_infringement">contributory liability</a> whenever excerpts of protected work is used in materials or assignments. Currently, only a few countries have enacted such provision and as such, members of the knowledge community may face repercussions for sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>The digital age brought with it technological protection measures that prevent individuals from using copyrighted works in educational and research materials. Out of the 189 WIPO member states only 63 have enacted provisions in national legislation to provide for flexibilities, limitations and exceptions to technological protection measures. Under the proposed treaty, member states will have to make sure that legal remedies against the circumvention of technological protection measures do not prevent educational and research activities. In a world where upload filters and content ID-inspired systems are becoming the norm, this provision is of the utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The proposed treaty supports the educational goal of the Wikimedia communities, and is a step toward the adoption of fair use globally, which benefits us all. With the upcoming EU Copyright Directive <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/06/29/eu-copyright-proposal-will-hurt-web-wikipedia/">striking a blow to free expression and knowledge</a> and missing the opportunity to introduce an effective exception for educational use, the proposed treaty is a beam of light in these troubled times. If the proposed treaty is adopted, the the education and research community can benefit from common, flexible standards around the world that better promote <a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/policy-landing/access/">access to knowledge</a>.</p>

I <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives/Lifecycle">started the Lifecycle objective</a> and proposed it as a lead to the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/council/">Fedora Council</a> to house what I hope will be improvements to Fedora lifecycle.</p>

<p>One of the most important goals is to diversify the community ownership of our releases. This involves <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives/Lifecycle/Problem_statements">a fairly extensive set of changes</a> in Fedora. It will need effort from a number of teams that work on release processes and services. For that reason, I&#8217;m proposing we pause the release cycle after the release of Fedora 30.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/G5GMQZ5OY444EIGT2TJVP45N2NNXUBMK/">posted this morning to the </a><em><a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/G5GMQZ5OY444EIGT2TJVP45N2NNXUBMK/">devel</a></em><a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/G5GMQZ5OY444EIGT2TJVP45N2NNXUBMK/"> list</a> to start gathering feedback and input from a wider group on the ideas around the ideas in the writeup. The most important feedback comes from those who are involved in those processes and services. But constructive feedback is welcome from any part of Fedora. Please take the time to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives/Lifecycle/Problem_statements">read the whole document</a> and understand the goals and benefits for Fedora.</p>

<p>One side note: You may have seen an earlier thread from Matthew Miller about a longer-term maintenance release. The Lifecycle objective would certainly make that possible. But the point of the objective is not that in particular. It&#8217;s to allow more flexibility in what we release and when &#8212; and thus make Fedora more interesting and hospitable for many more people to participate in, and build on, the project deliverables.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to express gratitude for participation by Matthew, Jim Perrin, Adam Williamson, Josh Boyer, and others to illuminate key ideas and issues that found their way into this draft and other conversations. While it&#8217;s true that any open source community can excel at collaboration, Fedora folks like these really do walk the walk!</p>

This year was the 18th edition and it was held on October 27.</p>

<p>The event is promoted by the <a href="http://www.ils.org/">Italian Linux Society</a>, and it is independently organized in many cities all around the country by groups of volunteers, LUGs and various associations. Even if it is highly fragmented (many little events in many cities), it is probably the biggest Italian event related to Linux and FLOSS, that is directly organized by people involved in the communities and by ordinary users.</p>

<p>The aim of such event is to to promote Linux and FLOSS in general: in each city there are many talks, presentations and installation parties. The target audience is not limited to computer enthusiasts, hackers or IT professionals, but newbies, students and curious citizens are welcome as well.</p>

<h2>Fedora representation</h2>

<p>As far as we know, this year Fedora was represented by ambassadors and advocates in five events: in <a href="https://www.lumacaonline.org/kiwi/index.php/Eventi:LinuxDay18">Massa Carrara</a> (event organized by L.U.Ma.Ca.) with a talk about Silverblue oriented to ordinary Linux users held by alciregi; in <a href="https://www.ivlug.it/linux-day/linuxday-2018-sabato-27-ottobre/">Ivrea</a> (event organized by IvLug) with a talk titled &#8220;Fedora: an up to date distro for everyone&#8221; held by dariolesca; and in <a href="http://www.coderdojobrianza.it/event/linux-day-2018/">Mezzago</a> (event organized by&nbsp;K12 APS, BrigX Bernareggio and CoderDojoBrianza) with a talk titled &#8220;The three souls of the web in the service of the communities: information, collaboration, innovation&#8221; held by mailga. In <a href="http://lugrieti.linux.it/linuxday-2018/">Rieti</a> (event organized by lugrieti) and in <a href="http://linuxday.gulch.it/">Cagliari</a> (event organized by GULCh) there were Fedora booths thanks to gabrycaos and veon.</p>

<h3>Some details from Massa Carrara (by alciregi)</h3>

<p>In Carrara there were at least 30 people witnessing the talks, plus a lot of people jumped in just to ask something or to see some projects exposed in the dedicated area, and just to grab some swag. The attendees were mainly long time Linux users using various distributions, and some high school students. The topic of the talk related to Fedora Silverblue has produced a lot of excitement, mainly because on the Linux desktop ecosystem there have been not too many novelties in the last times. On the other side the new kind of Linux distribution was seen as too destabilizing in the classical day to day average user workflow. However, the container technology brought to the desktop was seen as an interesting opportunity, and this is particularly true for students looking to learn modern technologies for a future job in the IT field. <a href="https://www.lumacaonline.org/materiale18/Silverblue.odp">Here</a> you can find the slides (in Italian).</p>

<h3>Some details from Ivrea (by dariolesca).</h3>

<p>In Ivrea, in the University room &#8220;Officina H&#8221;, at least 100 people have took part to the event: someone attending to all the talks and some other jumped in just to lurk and see what kind of event it was.<br>There were many talks about many topics, attendees seemed very interested and compelled, the Q&amp;A session at the end of each talk was very active.</p>

<p>There was a gadget booth, where people was able to grab some swag provided by Italian Linux Society and by the Fedora Project.<br>The PC used to show the slides of each talk was running Fedora 29 (still beta at the time).</p>

<p>The talk presented by me was titled &#8220;Fedora: una distro per tutti al passo coi tempi&#8221; (more or less translated to &#8220;Fedora: an up to date distro for everyone&#8221;). In addition it was showed how to keep many desktop environment on the same Fedora installation, and that it is possible to select one of them at each login. A note: Fedora was installed on an USB 3 stick.<br>The attendees have shown a strong interest, and many of them asked how to try it on their PC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ivlug.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Fedora-Una-distribuzione-GNU-Linux-al-passo-coi-tempi.pdf">Here</a> you can find the slides (in Italian).<br></p>

<h3>Some details from Mezzago (by mailga)</h3>

<p>The Linux Day held in Mezzago (&#8220;biblioteca&#8221;) didn&#8217;t saw the attendance of lots of people, maybe 20 &#8217;cause, as usual here in Italy, the Linux Day is very fragmented. Nevertheless the talks were very interesting and the people followed all of them paying lots of attention. Among the speakers there was the presence of Italo Vignoli and this raised the level of the talks.<br>About my speech, I explained (mainly referred to the Fedora community) how a community is built, the dynamics within , and a sort of &#8220;netiquette&#8221; to get requested things done.</p>

<p>It was a half-an-hour talk so I could not dive in the deep of the communities flows. For the people who want give a glance to the talks, <a href="https://twitter.com/coderdojobza">here</a> the slides and the full speeches (in Italian).</p>

<h2>What we have learned</h2>

<p>We know that the Italian Fedora Community as a whole is a little bit inactive, compared to some years ago. We know many Italian Fedora users, but there is a lack of people with a compelling interest in animating or actively participating in a community. However there are various Italian contributors, but each of us does their work under the hood as an individual, in some cases collaborating directly in the international community. </p>

<p>Users sometimes don&#8217;t care about the possibility to contribute to the project (to any project, actually). It seems that people look at a Linux distribution as a product, like a smartphone or a commercial software, and it is particularly true for young people: if it works it is nice, but if they encounter a problem it is more simple to complain or to switch to another distro. At a first glance, it seems difficult to on-board them as contributors. Many people is not aware that there are many ways to contribute inside a community.</p>

<h2>What we can do in the future</h2>

<p>For sure in the near future we can work in order to convince current contributors to head up and participate to events with talks ad workshops.<br>
Looking to the next year Linux Day, during the coming 12 months, we could try to solicit more people (be they regular users or contributors) to submit speeches talking about the Fedora Project and to organize Fedora booths in more cities than this year event. In addition we should fight laziness, and we could try to invite regular users to contribute and look with interest to the community behind the project, and not only to the technology.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>For over two decades, free and open source software has given us the ability to empower anyone to become collective owners of impactful technology with the freedom to study, change, and share technology solutions for social good. At the Digital Impact Alliance, we strongly believe in what these freedoms can offer to those working in the international development, peacemaking and humanitarian relief sectors. Open source software is an important part of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/">Principles of Digital Development</a>, which is why our <a href="https://www.osc.dial.community/">Open Source Center</a> supports those contributing to and applying this technology in development work.</p>
<p>While open source has long been used in the ICT4D sector, the open source community still faces challenges to represent different demographics despite the movement’s aspiration of inclusiveness and global reach. Given that the codes and algorithms underpinning digital technologies inherently reflect the values and backgrounds of those who build and contribute to them, women’s underrepresentation in open source is a challenge to the community’s commitment to inclusivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-17650 size-medium" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover-229x300.png 229w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/OpenSourceCover.png 629w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /></a></p>
<p>Recognizing the intersectional nature of this issue, DIAL conducted new research to explore the experiences of women working in open source and better understand why women are underrepresented and do not always feel welcome in this community.</p>
<p>Initially shared at MozFest 2018, the report entitled <em><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GenderOSS_v10_PDF.pdf">Towards A More Gender-Inclusive Open Source Community</a></em> provides a framework for action and highlights a set of <em>reformist, conformist, and transformist </em>recommendations on how different stakeholders – organizations supporting women in coding, open source communities, employers, conference organizers, governments and funders – can work together to build a more inclusive environment.</p>
<p>This research report is the culmination of a thorough review of the literature, hundreds of hours of dialogue with leaders of, active participants in, and people who have turned away from open source communities. The findings of the research explore how these communities can help reflect the needs of women, provide them with the support they need to be successful and ultimately enable them to contribute to the development of more effective, equitable and inclusive open source products.</p>
<p>We’re eager to share this research and we welcome your feedback on the report and our future work at DIAL’s Open Source Center Forum at  <a href="https://forum.osc.dial.community/">https://forum.osc.dial.community/</a>.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-13T18:46:52.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Robert Fernandez</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In recent weeks, the world learned about Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Strickland">Donna Strickland</a>, only the third woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. It also learned that <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/04/donna-strickland-wikipedia/">Wikipedia lacked an article on Strickland</a> amongst its over five million articles. Wikipedia subsequently received <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nobel-prize-winner-physics-2018-donna-strickland-wikipedia-entry-deleted-sexism-equality-a8572006.html">justifiable</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/10/08/why-nobel-winner-donna-strickland-didnt-have-wikipedia-page/">criticism </a>for its low percentage of female editors, its editing culture, and its <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/18/wikipedia-mirror-world-gender-biases/">replication of the world&#8217;s systemic biases</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this coverage included little about more mundane problems encountered by editors who are trying to document academics and academic fields on Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is the encyclopedia anyone can edit, and of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics">130,000+ volunteers</a> who edit the English Wikipedia on any given month, the majority are not academic experts. They lack sources to cite and photos to use for the articles they want to write, and they don&#8217;t always know where to find them.</p>
<p>This is where academics can step in to help and ensure there are Wikipedia articles documenting the achievements of the next generation of Donna Stricklands. Contributing to Wikipedia is rewarding, but it can be a significant commitment of time and effort.  It&#8217;s important to have Wikipedia events at your institution, but there are plenty of other ways you can help that don&#8217;t involve one-off editing events:</p>
<h3>1. Write about your field on Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Follow the examples of future doctor <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/03/07/the-keilana-effect/">Emily Temple-Wood </a>and Dr. <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/07/13/jess-wade/">Jess Wade</a> and take stewardship of the articles in your field. Write or contribute to articles on important people and topics in your area of expertise and encourage your colleagues to do so as well. Members of numerous organizations, from the American Chemical Society to the National Women&#8217;s Studies Association, are already engaged with Wikipedia articles in their relevant academic domains.</p>
<h3> 2. Have your students write about your field on Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Encourage your students to do so as well, perhaps in the form of classroom assignments. The non-profit organization <a href="https://wikiedu.org/">Wiki Education Foundation</a> provides curricular and technical assistance to hundreds of college courses each semester whose students are contributing to Wikipedia as part of their coursework. Students who reluctantly write papers for an audience of one respond positively when presented with the opportunity to contribute to a globally-accessible web of knowledge.</p>
<h3>3. Critique an article in your field</h3>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the time or inclination to contribute to Wikipedia, you can still help Wikipedia by critiquing an article.  For example, Karen Lemmey, a curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, offered <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American-art-museum-karenlemmey-lecture-thegreekslave.webm">a brief critique</a> of the Wikipedia article on the sculpture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek_Slave"><em>The Greek Slave</em></a>.  This critique, recorded by Professor Andrew Lih and made available on Wikipedia, provided direction for his American University students to significantly improve that Wikipedia article.  If you’d like to do this yourself, you don&#8217;t have to go to the trouble of making a video—you can simply leave a few quick comments and sources on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages">&#8220;talk&#8221; page</a>, a discussion page for each article you can reach by clicking on the &#8220;talk&#8221; tab, to help Wikipedia editors with your expertise.</p>
<h3>4. Document the important people in your field</h3>
<p>There are other ways your expertise can help. Write and publish biographies documenting important colleagues and their contributions to your field.  Biographical articles about academics, especially if they are in a peer-reviewed journal, are one of the most important and useful sources a editor can draw on to write a Wikipedia article. The lack of these sources are a major reason why Wikipedia articles on academics like Donna Strickland don&#8217;t get written or get deleted. Consider contributing and publishing these kinds of profiles in your field&#8217;s journals if they aren&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>Even if these articles exist, they might not be accessible to most editors. For example, the journal <em>American Psychologist </em>publishes numerous short biographical articles about award winners and other major contributors to the field, but if you try to read them on the web, you&#8217;ll be confronted with a pay-wall charging you $11.95 to read each one. Unless a Wikipedia editor is affiliated with an academic library that subscribes to <em>American Psychologist, </em>they won&#8217;t be able to read that profile and a Wikipedia article on that particular academic likely won&#8217;t get written. Even if your journal isn&#8217;t open access, consider making these types of articles open-access to facilitate the creation of Wikipedia articles on people in your field.</p>
<h3>5. Photograph the important people in your field</h3>
<p>Writing isn&#8217;t the only way you can contribute to Wikipedia. We often hear complaints that many Wikipedia articles lack photographs of their subjects, but we simply can&#8217;t grab photos off the web. Like Wikipedia&#8217;s written content, almost all photos we use* must be freely licensed and reusable.  Wikipedia editors do their best to find, create, and contribute as many photos as they can. For example, Wikimedia District of Columbia volunteers go to events like the National Book Festival to take <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:2018_National_Book_Festival">photos of people for their Wikipedia articles</a>.</p>
<p>Academics can contribute in the same way. Document your conferences and colleagues and put the photos on Flickr or Wikimedia Commons.  Remember that we can only use freely licensed photos that can be redistributed, and non-commercial licenses prevent their use on Wikipedia. For example, the American Library Association does a fantastic job of providing photos of their conferences and leading contributors to our field. Unfortunately, they post them on Flickr with a non-commercial license, so many Wikipedia articles about important librarians, including about half of the most recent presidents of the ALA, lack photographs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that Wikipedia isn&#8217;t something created in a factory somewhere by people you&#8217;ll never meet. It&#8217;s the encyclopedia anyone can edit, and that includes you too. Scholarly communication shouldn&#8217;t be limited to conferences, journals, and your students.  Come help Wikipedia volunteers as they assemble the world&#8217;s most widely-used and largest information resource.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-09T17:41:38.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Saskia Ehlers, Houssem Abida and Ed Erhart</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Have you ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_heterosexuality">compulsory heterosexuality</a>? This concept described how heterosexuality is assumed, enforced and viewed as an obligation regardless of one’s own sexual preferences, and it was the subject of one of the articles that members of the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_LGBT%2B/Portal">LGBT user group</a> wrote about in different languages in Stockholm, Sweden, last August.</p>
<p>The event was organized by a group of Wikimedians coming from Asia, Africa, and Europe, all united by one single cause: promoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> Culture and achievements online. For four days in August, 12 participants took part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europride">EuroPride</a> 2018 in Stockholm. In two days of editing, the participants created, translated, and improved over 80 LGBT-related Wikipedia articles in more than 10 languages, in addition to adding over 300 photos. They also participated in a human rights summit, and the user group walked in a pride parade for the first time. For some participants, it was the first time they had the chance to walk in a pride parade in their life, as they don&#8217;t exist in their home countries.</p>
<p>The meeting gave LGBT user group members the opportunity to meet and exchange their personal experiences both inside and outside the Wikimedia movement. They also strategized about how they could support one another through an international network. Next year, two similar events will be organized in Vienna for EuroPride and New York for World Pride.</p>
<p>We talked with two organizers of the Stockholm event: Houssem Abida and Saskia Ehlers. If you&#8217;d like to contribute to making the flag more visible on Wikipedia, join the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Loves_Pride">Wiki Loves Pride</a> initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the current state of LGBT content on Wikipedia? Where is it strong, and where is it weak?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Houssem Abida</strong>: I think LGBT content needs a lot of work on Wikipedia, especially in some specific languages. For example, you can find articles that cover almost all sexual concepts in English, but it is very hard to find them in Arabic. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_king">drag kings</a> are a very basic concept in LGBT culture, but they didn&#8217;t exist on the Arabic Wikipedia before the Stockholm edit-a-thon.</p>
<p>Also, many important activists are still not showcased enough through the platform; it is our role to write about them.</p>
<p>That said, I think a strong point of Wikipedia is that it gives a relatively good and updated general overview of the situation LGBT people are living in every country (through the articles &#8220;LGBT in X&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>How does the emerging <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017">Wikimedia 2030</a> strategy fit with improving coverage of LGBT topics on Wikipedia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Houssem Abida: </strong>I think the strategy is very supportive to our case and in fighting for it. For example, the way it emphasizes partnerships is very important for us and makes our work stronger and structured (NGOs provide references and documents, help with logistics, help us access difficult communities, etc.). Also, focusing on local communities is something we need, as it provides us with deeper communication channels and allows to reach a bigger and more vulnerable community (when it comes for the sexual education role that Wikipedia plays, for example).</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>What gave you the idea to combine EuroPride with peace advocacy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>This is a somewhat longer story. My grandparents met through a peace organization after World War II. They took part in workcamps where they rebuilt churches and houses with teams of young people from different countries that had previously been at war. The intention of those kinds of exchanges and organizations was for the participants to get to know each other&#8217;s cultures and become friends, so that it would in the future it would not be possible to blindly hate and slaughter people just because they had another nationality, culture, or spoke another language.</p>
<p>When the time came I became active in such an organization as well. I was a camp leader and organizer in Germany and other countries. Through that I met Thomas Schallhart from Austria, who was like me active within the Wikimedia movement and the same peace organization. We decided to combine both passions in the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/13/digest-wikipedia-for-peace/">Wikipedia for Peace</a> project. In this, young people from different countries came together to write about a certain peace related topic on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I had organized a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_for_Peace_Madrid_World_Pride">LGBT-related Wikimedia event in Madrid in 2017</a> because the World Pride took place there then. It was truly great and very fruitful, so I wanted to repeat this in Stockholm—and as Thomas had lived in Sweden for several years, we had the necessary connections to make that idea a reality.</p>
<p>The reason why we see writing about LGBT issues as a topic suitable for the Wikipedia for Peace format is that aside from nationality, culture, and language barriers, people are also excluded or hated because of their sexual preferences. Both Thomas and I have experienced that personally. This format gives us the chance to spread knowledge in different language versions, and through education create tolerance and awareness. In Madrid, for example, participants wrote the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyz_language">Kyrgysz</a> Wikipedia article on sexual diversity. On the other hand people can have human exchanges and gain understanding through this. One thing that I can think about here is how one person in Madrid described how and why they had bullied homosexuals in their youth, and how the phenomenon is very present in their culture until today. That same person continued to work on the topic after the event was finished. I think that these events and sharing experiences with very different people can change a person&#8217;s mind and life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide what topics to cover at the Stockholm edit-a-thon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saskia Ehlers: </strong>People had different ideas on what to write about, so at the end we covered a wide variety of topics. One person for example promised to their bisexual friend that they would write about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphobia">biphobia</a> in their language as there is sometimes discrimination within the LGBT community towards bisexuals. Another person who is a doctor in real life wrote about sex change surgery. We had a reflection round each day and talked about what each person wrote about during the day. So people also gave each other ideas and influenced each other on what to write about. We also had input in terms of talks from participants. In one talk different gender concepts from all over the world were mentioned, which led one participant to write about the Southern Mexican concept for the third gender Muxe. We took part in the human rights summit in which important activists and speakers from different countries were present. One of them was Sedef Çakmak who was the first openly gay politician to be elected into office in Turkey. Some people wrote about her in their language versions. We also took a picture of her at the summit, which is now included in her article.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong>Have you run into any difficulties? If so, what?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s somewhat difficult to finance and organize such international exchanges through Wikimedia funds. Conference grants don&#8217;t really fit because the projects are designed to be low budget. Travel costs can only be reimbursed from chapters with a lot of money for community support, such as Germany, Switzerland or Austria. All of means that it is a lot harder for people from poorer countries or regions with no user groups or chapters to participate. This made the financing and logistics somewhat difficult and time consuming. A rapid grant alone is not sufficient to cover the flights, accommodation, and food costs during the event. Another kind grant to organize such exchanges like a European fund would be great. We proposed this idea at Wikimania in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Aside from that we&#8217;d like to thank the Austrian, German and Swedish chapter for the financial and in kind support of the event.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I was in the third year of my CS graduation course when I started exploring Open Source communities and Fedora in particular. As someone who was completely new to almost everything, it was tough to get started.

At the end of my semester, April 2016, I decided to take action and joined the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/commops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CommOps group</a> &#8211; my first step towards being a Fedora contributor.

      <h5>2018-11-08T10:00:51.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">alastairporter</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We had an in-person meeting at the <a href="https://upf.edu/web/mtg"><abbr title="Music Technology Group">MTG</abbr></a> during the <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit/18">MetaBrainz summit</a> to discuss the status and future of <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org/">AcousticBrainz</a>. We came up with a rough outline of things that we want to work on over the next year or so. This is a small list of tasks that we think will have a good impact on the image of AcousticBrainz and encourage people to use our data more.</p>
<h2>State of AcousticBrainz</h2>
<p>AcousticBrainz has a <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org/statistics-graph">huge database of submissions</a> (over 10 million now, thanks everyone!), but we are currently not using the wealth of data to our advantage. For the last year we’ve not had a core developer from MetaBrainz or MTG working on existing or new features in AcousticBrainz. However, we now have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/paramsingh">Param</a>, who is including AcousticBrainz in his role with MetaBrainz</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rsh7">Rashi</a>, who <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/">worked on AcousticBrainz for <abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GSoC</abbr></a> and is going to continue working with us</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/philtgun">Philip</a>, who is starting a PhD at MTG, focused on some of the algorithms/data going into AcousticBrainz</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alastair">Alastair</a>, who now has more time to put towards management of the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, we&#8217;re glad to present an outline of our next tasks for AcousticBrainz:</p>
<h2>Short-term</h2>
<p>Some small tasks that are quick to finish and we can use to show off uses of the data in AcousticBrainz</p>
<h3>Merge Philip’s similarity, including an API endpoint</h3>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1479769">Philip’s masters thesis</a> project from last year uses PostgreSQL search to find acoustically similar recordings to a target recording. This uses the features in AcousticBrainz. We need to ensure that PostgreSQL can handle the scale of data that we have.</p>
<p>An extension of this work is to use the similarity to allow us to remove bad duplicate submissions (we can take all recordings with the same MBID and see if they are similar to each other, if one is not similar we can assume that it’s not actually the same as the other duplicates, and mark it as bad). We want to make these results available via an API too, so that others can check this information as well.</p>
<h3>Merge Existing PRs</h3>
<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server/pulls">many great <abbr title="pull requests">PRs</abbr></a> from various people which Alastair didn’t merge over the last year. We&#8217;re going to spend some time getting these patches merged to show that we’re open to contributions!</p>
<h3>Publish our Existing models</h3>
<p>In research at MTG we’ve come up with a few more detailed genre models based on tag/genre data that we’ve collected from a number of sources. We believe that these models can be more useful that the current genre models that we have. The AcousticBrainz infrastructure supports adding new models easily, so we should spend some time integrating these. There are a few tasks that need to be done to make sure that these work</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that high-level dumps will dump this new data (If we have an existing high-level dump we need to make a new one including the new data)</li>
<li>Ensure that we compute high-level data for all old submissions (we currently don’t have a system to go back and compute high-level data for old submissions with a new model, the high-level extractor has to be improved to support this)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Update/fix some pages</h3>
<p>We have a number of issues reported about unclear text on some pages and grammar that we can improve. Especially important are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/AB-373">API description</a> (we should remove the documentation from the main website and just have a link to <a href="https://acousticbrainz.readthedocs.io/">the ReadTheDocs page</a>)</li>
<li>Front page (Show off what we have in the project in more detail, instead of just a wall of text)</li>
<li>Data page (instead of just showing tables of data, try and work out a better way of presenting the information that we have)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fix Picard plugin</h3>
<p>When AB was down during our migration we were serving HTML from our API pages, which caused Picard to crash if the AB plugin was enabled while trying to get AB data. This should be an easy fix in the Picard plugin.</p>
<h2>High Impact</h2>
<p>These are tasks that we want to complete first, that we know will have a high impact on the quality of the data that we produce.</p>
<h3>Frame-level data</h3>
<p>We want to extract and store more detailed information about our recordings. This relies on working being done in MTG to develop a new extractor to allow us to get more detailed information. It will also give us other improvements to data that we have in AB that we know is bad. This data is much bigger than our current data when stored in JSON (hundreds of times larger), so we need to develop a more efficient way of storing submissions. This could involve storing the data in a well-known binary data exchange format. A bunch of subtasks for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the essentia extractor software</li>
<li>Decide on how to store items on the server (file format, store on disk instead of database)</li>
<li>Work out a way to deal with features from two versions of the extractor (do we keep accepting old data? What happens if someone requests data for a recording for which we have the old extractor data but not the new one?)</li>
<li>Upgrade clients to support this (Change to HTTPS, change to the new API URL structure, ensure that clients check before submission if they’re the latest version, work out how to compress data or perform a duplicate check before submission)</li>
<li>Deduplication (If we have much larger data files, don’t bother storing 200 copies for a single Beatles song if we find that we already have 5-10 submissions that are all the same)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MusicBrainz Metadata</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/08/12/gsoc-2018-more-detailed-integration-of-acousticbrainz-with-musicbrainz/">Rashi’s GSoC project</a> in 2018 helped us to replicate parts of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz. This allows us to do amazing things like keep up-to-date information about MBID redirects, and do search/browse/filtering of data based on relationships such as Artists just by making a simple database query. We want to merge this work and start using it.</p>
<h3>Dumps</h3>
<p>When we changed the database architecture of AcousticBrainz in 2015 we stopped making data dumps, making people rely on using the API to retrieve data. This is not scalable, and many people have asked for this data. We want to fix all of the outstanding issues that we’ve found in the current dumps system and start producing periodic dumps for people to download.</p>
<h3>Build more models</h3>
<p>In addition to the existing models that we’ve already built (see above, “Publish our Existing models”), we have been collecting a lot of metadata that we could use to make even more high-level models which we think will have a value in the community. Build these models and publicly release them, using our current machine learning framework.</p>
<h2>Wishlist</h2>
<p>These are tasks that we want to complete that will show off the data that we have in AcousticBrainz and allow us to do more things with the data, but should come after the high-impact tasks.</p>
<h3>Expose AB data on MusicBrainz</h3>
<p>As part of the process to cross-pollinate the brainz’s, we want to be able to show a small subset of AB data that we trust on the MB website. This could include information such as <abbr title="beats per minute">BPM</abbr>, Key, and results from some of our high-level models.</p>
<h3>Improve music playback</h3>
<p>On the detail page for recordings we currently have a simple YouTube player which tries to find a recording by doing text search. We want to improve the reliability and functionality of this player to include other playback services and take advantage of metadata that we already have in the MusicBrainz database.</p>
<h3>Scikit-learn models</h3>
<p>The future of machine learning is moving towards deep learning, and our current high-level infrastructure written in the custom Gaia project by MTG is preventing us from integrating improved machine learning algorithms to the data that we have. We would like to rewrite the training/evaluation process using <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, which is a well known Python library for general machine learning tasks. This will make it easier for us to take advantage of improvements in machine learning, and also make our environment more approachable to people outside the MusicBrainz community.</p>
<h3>Dataset editor improvements</h3>
<p>Part of the high-level/machine learning process involves making datasets that can be used to train models. We have a basic tool for building datasets, however it is difficult to use for making large datasets. We should look into ways of making this tool more useful for people who want to contribute datasets to AcousticBrainz.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>With the integration of the MusicBrainz database into AcousticBrainz, we will be able to let people search for metadata related to items which we know only exist in AcousticBrainz. We think that this is a good way for people to explore the data, and also for people to make new datasets (see above). We also want to provide a way that lets people search for feature data in the database (e.g. “all recordings in the key of Am, between 100 and 110BPM”).</p>
<h3>API updates</h3>
<p>As part of the 2018 MetaBrainz summit we decided to unify the structure of the APIs, including root path and versioning. We should make AcousticBrainz follow this common plan, while also supporting clients who still access the current API.</p>
<p>We should become more in-line with the MetaBrainz policy of API access, including user-agent reporting, rate limiting, and API key use.</p>
<h3>Request specific data</h3>
<p>Many services who use the API only need a very small bit of information from a specific recording, and so it’s often not efficient to return the entire low-level or high-level JSON document. It would be nice for clients to be able to request a specific field(s) for a recording. This ties in with the “Expose AcousticBrainz data on MusicBrainz” task above.</p>
<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>Fix all our bugs and make AcousticBrainz an amazing open tool for MIR research.</p>

      <h5>2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 11.1, 10.6, 9.6.11, 9.5.15, 9.4.20, and 9.3.25. This release fixes one security issue as well as bugs reported over the last three months.</p> <p>All users using the affected versions of PostgreSQL should update as soon as possible. Please see the notes on "Updating" below for any post-update steps that may be required if you are using <code>pg_stat_statements</code> in your installation.</p> <p>This update is also the final release for PostgreSQL 9.3, which is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes. If your environment still uses PostgreSQL 9.3, please make plans to update to a community supported version as soon as possible. Please see our <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Security Issues</h2> <p>One security vulnerability has been closed by this release:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16850">CVE-2018-16850</a>: SQL injection in <code>pg_upgrade</code> and <code>pg_dump</code>, via <code>CREATE TRIGGER ... REFERENCING</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Versions Affected: 10, 11</p> <p>Using a purpose-crafted trigger definition, an attacker can run arbitrary SQL statements with superuser privileges when a superuser runs <code>pg_upgrade</code> on the database or during a pg_dump dump/restore cycle. This attack requires a <code>CREATE</code> privilege on some non-temporary schema or a <code>TRIGGER</code> privilege on a table. This is exploitable in the default PostgreSQL configuration, where all users have <code>CREATE</code> privilege on <code>public</code> schema.</p> <h2>Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2> <p>This update also fixes numerous bugs that were reported in the last several months. Some of these issues affect only version 11, but many affect all supported versions.</p> <p>These releases include fixes that:</p> <ul> <li>Ensure that automatically created child indexes are created in the same tablespace as the parent partitioned index</li> <li>Fix several crashes with triggers</li> <li>Fix problems with applying <code>ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS</code> to a partitioned temporary table</li> <li>Fix how <code>NULL</code> values are handled when using <code>LEFT JOIN</code> with a parallelized hash join</li> <li>Several fixes around using named or defaulted arguments in <code>CALL</code> statements</li> <li>Fix for strict aggregate functions (i.e. aggregates that cannot accept <code>NULL</code> inputs) with ORDER BY columns that enforces the strictness check</li> <li>Fix with <code>CASE</code> statements where an expression was cast to an array type</li> <li>Disable an optimization for updating expression indexes in order to prevent a crash</li> <li>Fix a memory leak that occurred on a specific case of using a SP-GiST index</li> <li>Fix for <code>pg_verify_checksums</code> incorrectly reporting on files that are not expected to have checksums</li> <li>Prevent the PostgreSQL server from starting when <code>wal_level</code> is set to a value that cannot support an existing replication slot</li> <li>Ensure that the server will process already-received NOTIFY and SIGTERM interrupts before waiting for client input</li> <li>Allow PL/Ruby to work with newer versions of PostgreSQL</li> <li>Fix for character-class checks on Windows for Unicode characters above U+FFFF, which affected full-text search as well as <code>contrib/ltree</code> and <code>contrib/pg_trgm</code></li> <li>Fix a case where <code>psql</code> would not report the receipt of a message from a <code>NOTIFY</code> call until after the next command</li> <li>Fix build problems on macOS 10.14 (Mojave)</li> <li>Several build fixes for the Windows platform</li> </ul> <p>This updates also contains tzdata release 2018g for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Morocco, and Russia (Volgograd), plus historical corrections for China, Hawaii, Japan, Macau, and North Korea.</p> <h2>PostgreSQL 9.3 is End-of-Life (EOL)</h2> <p>PostgreSQL 9.3 is now end-of-life and will no longer receive any bug or security fixes. We urge users to start planning an upgrade to a later version of PostgreSQL as soon as possible. Please see our <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more information.</p> <h2>Updating</h2> <p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.</p> <p>If your system is using <code>pg_stat_statements</code> and you are running a version of PostgreSQL 10 or PostgreSQL 11, we advise that you execute the following command after upgrading:</p> <p><code>ALTER EXTENSION pg_stat_statements UPDATE;</code></p> <p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional, post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for details.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">Download</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release.html">Release Notes</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/">Security Page</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">Versioning Policy</a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/postgresql">Follow @postgresql on Twitter</a></li> </ul>

        <p>DUBLIN – Yesterday afternoon, the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) and NetHope convened a group of donor and implementing government and non-governmental organizations to discuss shared challenges and opportunities to work more closely together in 2019. The group committed to initiating a dialogue aimed at investing more time and resources together to identify ways organizations can collectively work towards the goal of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of digital solutions for development to reach more people across the globe.</p>
<p>Executives from several NetHope member organizations joined donors from US and European agencies to discuss broad areas of potential collaboration, including strategies to increase integration; joint methods of promoting greater inclusion; common strategies to drive leveraged investment; and practical methods where they can promote more responsible data policies so that new technologies equally benefit and protect the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
<p>“Technology continues to advance at an increasing rate but has been slow to reach many in the developing world,” said Kate Wilson, CEO of the Digital Impact Alliance. “Only through strong collaboration and information sharing between all actors in the digital development ecosystem can we ensure anyone, anywhere at any time can access life-enhancing services enabled by digital technology.”</p>
<p>The four challenge areas discussed by the donor and implementing organizations are reflected in DIAL’s latest report: “<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/resource/donor-organizations-the-principles-for-digital-development-a-landscape-assessment-and-gap-analysis/">Donor Organizations &amp; the Principles for Digital Development: A Landscape Assessment and Gap Analysis</a>.” The report provides a snapshot of the current capacity within donor organizations and recommendations on how development impact can be improved through the more effective use of technology and digital methodologies, including adoption and practice of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/">Principles for Digital Development.</a></p>
<p>“The Digital Principles are a cornerstone for development organizations who are using technology to improve outcomes,” said Dr. Dirk Aßmann, Director General of Sectoral Department at GIZ.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the donor and implementing organizations, Dr. Aßmann shared the pledge made to work more closely together in 2019 to support the recommendations made in the new DIAL report and deliver more value for money working with partners.</p>
<p>“Digital technology, when used well, is a key tool to more effectively and efficiently deliver better development outcomes,” said Lauren Woodman, CEO of NetHope. “Working together, DIAL and NetHope are committed to a robust, ongoing dialogue with the goal of bringing donors, implementing organizations, and technology providers together in partnership to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.”</p>

      <h5>2018-11-02T10:00:24.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Freso</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the things various people have asked MusicBrainz for time and time again has been genres. However, genres are <em>hard</em> to do right and they&#8217;re very much subjective—with MusicBrainz dealing almost exclusively with objective data. It&#8217;s been a recurring discussion on almost all of <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/MusicBrainz_Summit">our summits</a>, but a couple years ago (with some help from our friend Alastair Porter and his research colleagues at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/">UPF</a>), we finally came to a path forward—and recently Nicolás Tamargo (reosarevok) finally turned that path forward into code… which has now been released! You can see it in action on e.g., <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e">Nine Inch Nails’ Year Zero release group</a>.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For now genres are <em>exactly the same as <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Folksonomy_Tagging">(folksonomy) tags</a></em> behind the scenes; some tags simply have become the chosen ones and are listed and presented as genres. The list of which tags are considered as genres is currently <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/entities.json#L666">hardcoded</a>, and no doubt it is missing a lot of our users&#8217; favourite genres. We plan to expand the genre list based on your requests, so if you find a genre that is missing from it, request it by <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10032&amp;issuetype=2&amp;summary=Enter%20the%20genre%20name%20here!">adding a style ticket</a> with the &#8220;Genres&#8221; component.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, genres are very subjective, so just like with folksonomy tags, you can upvote and downvote genres you agree or disagree with on any given entity, and you can also submit genre(s) for the entity that no one has added yet.</p>
<h3>What about the API?</h3>
<p>A bunch of the people asking for genres in MusicBrainz have been <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Enabled_Applications">application developers</a>, and this type of people are usually more interested in how to actually extract the genres from our data.</p>
<p>The method to request genres mirrors that of tags: you can use <code>inc=genres</code> to get all the genres everyone has proposed for the entity, or <code>inc=user-genres</code> to get all the genres you have proposed yourself (or both!). For the same release group as before, you&#8217;d want <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres</code></a> for the XML API and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json"><code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group/3bd76d40-7f0e-36b7-9348-91a33afee20e?inc=genres+user-genres&amp;fmt=json</code></a> for the JSON API.</p>
<p>Since genres are tags, all the genres will continue to be served with <code>inc=tags</code> as before as well. As such, you can always use the tag endpoint if you would rather filter the tags by your own genre list rather than follow the MusicBrainz one, or if you want to also get other non-genre tags (maybe you want moods, or maybe you&#8217;re really interested in finding artists who perform hip hop music <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/tag/death%20by%20murder">were murdered</a> – we won&#8217;t stop you!).</p>
<h4>I use the database directly, not the API</h4>
<p>You can parse the <code>tag</code>→<code>genres</code> from <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/raw/master/entities.json"><code>entities.json</code> in the root of the &#8220;musicbrainz-server&#8221; repository</a> which will give you a list of what we currently consider genres. Then you can simply compare any folksonomy tags from the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema#tag_table.2C_.26_the_.2A_tag_and_tag_raw_tables"><code>%_tag</code> tables</a>.</p>
<h4>Note about licensing</h4>
<p>One thing to keep in mind for any data consumers out there is that, as per our <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/Data_License">data licensing</a>, tags—and thus also genres—are not part of our &#8220;core (CC0-licensed) data&#8221;, but rather part of our &#8220;supplementary data&#8221; which is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-<strong>NonCommercial</strong> license</a>. Thus, if you wish to use our genre data for something commercial, you should get a commercial use license from the <a href="https://metabrainz.org/">MetaBrainz Foundation</a>. (Of course, if you&#8217;re going to provide a commercial product using data from MusicBrainz, you should always sign up as a <a href="https://metabrainz.org/supporters">supporter</a> regardless. :)).</p>
<h3>The future?</h3>
<p>We are hoping to get a better coverage of genres (especially genres outside of the Western tradition, of which we have a very small amount right now) with your help! That applies both to expanding the genre list and actually applying genres to entities. For the latter, remember that everyone can downvote your genre suggestion if they don&#8217;t agree, so don&#8217;t think too much about &#8220;what genres does the world think apply to this artist/release/whatever&#8221;. Just add what <strong>you</strong> feel is right; if everyone does that we&#8217;ll get much better information. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In the near future we&#8217;re hoping to move the genre list from the code to the database (which shouldn&#8217;t mean too much for most of you, other than less waiting between a new genre being proposed for the list and it being added, but is much better for future development). Also planned is a way to indicate that several tags are the same genre (so that if you tag something as &#8220;hiphop&#8221;, &#8220;hip hop&#8221; or &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; the system will understand that&#8217;s really all the same). Further down the line, who knows! We might eventually make genres into limited entities of a sort, in order to allow linking to, say, the appropriate Wikidata/Wikipedia pages. We might do some fun stuff. Time will tell!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working on a system to import listens automatically to ListenBrainz from Spotify and we&#8217;ve recently deployed it to <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org">the ListenBrainz beta site</a>. We would really appreciate it if you could help us test it out!</p>
<p>Please note that this is still beta software, there is a (very small) chance that we might miss a listen or two. So if you&#8217;re using this, please make sure that ListenBrainz is not the only service where you&#8217;re archiving your listens.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that importing the same listens from two different sources such as Last.FM and Spotify may cause the creation of duplicates in your listen history. If you opt into our automatic Spotify import, please do not use the Last.FM import or submit listens from other ListenBrainz clients. This is a temporary limitation while we find better ways to deduplicate listens.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for the caveats, please go ahead and use the new shiny <a href="https://beta.listenbrainz.org/profile/connect-spotify">Spotify Importer</a>. And feel free to report bugs on <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org">tickets.metabrainz.org</a> or <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">on IRC</a> in #metabrainz on Freenode.</p>

        <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is honored to join the <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/about-gni/">Global Network Initiative</a> (GNI) as an observer, an opportunity we hope will advance our efforts to champion freedom of expression and privacy for the Wikimedia community and beyond. GNI is a channel for collective action, advocating to governments and international institutions for policies and laws which promote free expression and privacy. As an observer to GNI, the Wikimedia Foundation will be able to benefit from this accomplished network of human rights defenders, and apply the insights we gain to our existing worldwide efforts to advance these two fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Principle to the Wikimedia movement is the idea of collaboration. Our projects are continually expanded and improved by a global community of volunteers, and we rely on donations from millions of people worldwide to continue operating year after year. Thus, when the opportunity arose to join GNI and collaborate with other leaders in both technology and digital rights, it was only natural for the Wikimedia Foundation to engage. Everyone who joins GNI, from large technology companies to civil society groups fighting for human rights online, has indicated their commitment to addressing and solving the most prescient issues in <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/">GNI’s focus areas</a>. By working with other member organizations and companies to further the rights of internet users worldwide, our participation as an observer in GNI will be just one of many ways we give back to the global community who supports the Wikimedia movement.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation understands that the protection and <a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/">promotion of human rights online</a> is essential to what we do. In order to provide access to knowledge for everyone, we must protect freedom of expression on our projects. In practice, this means we work to keep Wikipedia volunteers free from attempts to <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/22/a-letter-to-minister-ahmet-arslan/">block</a> or censor their writing on Wikipedia or requests to <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/07/20/wikimedia-releases-ninth-transparency-report/">remove their content</a>. We hope that by participating in GNI, we can share our experiences not only as a large internet platform, but as a mission-driven organization that holds our values firm even in the face of threats. In return, we are sure that the insights we will gain from the combined experience of GNI’s members will help us to better our initiatives to promote free expression for our communities.</p>
<p>In addition to freedom of expression, GNI and its members believe in respecting user privacy rights, including initiatives to increase <a href="https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/policy-issues/surveillance/">transparency and accountability in government surveillance</a>. We believe that strong privacy rules and opposition to surveillance are a fundamental part of the freedom that allows people to read and contribute to Wikipedia.  The Wikimedia Foundation has taken a clear stance defending our users’ right to privacy by taking part in a<a href="https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/"> lawsuit challenging the NSA’s upstream surveillance collection</a> activities and encrypting all traffic to and from Wikimedia projects through the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/">HTTPS protocol</a>. By taking concrete steps to defend user privacy, we are able to offer a unique perspective to other GNI members interested in how to better protect individuals. We hope that the connections we make within GNI will strengthen our own efforts to ensure that people are free to read and write Wikipedia without fear of anyone looking over their shoulder.</p>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation reflects our commitment to GNI’s mission in both our actions as the host of Wikipedia and our greater advocacy efforts through the Wikimedia movement. We are excited to collaborate with and learn from the variety of committed organizations and individuals who make up GNI in order to further these efforts to promote freedom of expression and privacy worldwide and ensure that everyone, everywhere can have access to knowledge.</p>

      <h5>2018-10-29T16:00:53.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Ben Vershbow and Sandra Fauconnier</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Earlier this year, the Wikimedia Foundation asked designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Oates">George Oates</a>, who has worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">Flickr</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library">Open Library</a>, among others, to conduct a deep dive into <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the free media repository that provides many of the images used on Wikipedia. We wanted a fresh pair of eyeballs, and we were particularly interested in Oates’ observations about possible areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Oates soon realized navigating Wikimedia Commons and finding interesting materials is challenging. She noted how the category system used to organize and tag media files on Commons is confusing and hides—not shows—the richness of content there. Other areas of improvement she mentioned include making both contributors and contributions more prominent and inviting, improving the user experience for new users, and actively recruiting more diverse gender participation in the project. (Oates noted that the group of administrators on Wikimedia Commons is internationally diverse, but not so much in terms of gender; this affects, for instance, the selection of featured images.)</p>
<p>Oates also identified several ways in which Wikimedia Commons can work more fruitfully with GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums). This is partially due to her background in the field: over the last decade, she as worked on a series of projects that have reimagined how the world engages with the collections of libraries, archives, and museums on the web.</p>
<p>She created <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">the Commons on Flickr,</a> which to this day stands as one of the most popular shared platforms for the world’s visual archives. She worked with the Internet Archive to lead the Open Library, a universal and openly editable catalog of the world’s books, connected to a digital lending library. More recently, she has worked with a variety of individual institutions to devise new ways of exploring their collections, like this experimental <a href="http://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org/">interface</a> to the Wellcome Library collection in the UK.</p>
<p>As we contemplate the future of cultural partnerships and the sharing of open collections in the Wikimedia movement, the Foundation asked George to do a short assignment: look at Wikimedia Commons through the lens of your background and experience, tell us candidly what you see, and suggest areas for improvement. We asked her to focus on the experience of new users, of cultural institutions, and to share with us some ideas of how Commons might evolve in the years ahead. Ben Vershbow (Director of Community Programs) and Sandra Fauconnier (Program Officer for GLAM and Structured Data) sat down with George to speak with her about her findings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Please tell us about yourself!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> I’ve <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeoates">worked</a> on the web since 1996, mostly in design-centered roles. I designed a lot of the user interface of the photosharing service, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, for the first few years, wrote its <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a> (with Heather Champ), and particularly enjoyed creating the privacy and safety tools that helped people coexist. Since 2008, I’ve specialised in the cultural heritage sector, and today, I’m based in London, building an edtech company called <a href="http://www.museuminabox.org/">Museum in a Box</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: What were your first impressions of Wikimedia Commons, looking at it as a &#8216;well-informed newbie&#8217; and with your background of having worked on Flickr, and Flickr Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p>Turns out, Commons is huge, dense, variegated, and alive.</p>
<p>It’s a system that’s about the size of Hong Kong (7.3 million people), but it’s only about 14 years old. Hong Kong has been settled for centuries. Just like the city, Commons is full of nooks and crannies, mazes, rules, signs, and people doing their thing.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4671557223/">map of Hong Kong</a> drawn using locations where photos were taken. “Blue pictures are by locals. Red pictures are by tourists. Yellow pictures might be by either.”</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59316"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59316 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4671557223_c7c11f6d3d_b.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For me, this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157624209158632">Locals and Tourists</a> project symbolises the way people move around software systems. Software can be learned like a place. You can move around it how you see fit, and inhabit corners you like. You can see other people in it, and follow, copy, like, ignore, and meet them.</p>
<p>This sort of socialising and movement happens on Commons too, but there’s an important difference between Commons, and, say, Facebook, and that’s that <em>the locals are building the city</em>. The ‘old school’ admins know the back alleys and the best noodles, and the Commons newbies head for the tourist hotspots.</p>
<p>So, in terms of my first impressions, I faced three primary challenges to get to a position where I could present ideas, not just observe:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am a newbie to the platform, unfamiliar with its rules, rituals and traditions</li>
<li>There’s a major usability challenge: Information vs Interface</li>
<li>The rules of engagement are not clear</li>
</ol>
<p>But, it also feels important to say that <strong><em>maybe there’s nothing wrong with it</em></strong>. The question in itself reveals a quiet tension. The Wikimedia Foundation’s team who support the Commons is in a hard, interesting position. They’re a crew of professional, philosophically aligned staff who find it difficult to help improve Commons. They meet resistance from the old guard, the community of volunteer admins and other long-term Commons folk who are there every day, have probably been there longer than anyone who works at the Foundation, feel deep ownership of the system, and can exercise deep control. They’ve patiently and visibly negotiated the dynamics of the system for the last fourteen years.</p>
<p>So, the question becomes <em>what is it OK for the Wikimedia Foundation to do</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Yes, you’ve put your finger on a very delicate aspect of our work. Fortunately, we are finding ways to channel great ideas from the community into well-defined efforts to improve the platform. The prime example right now is our work to integrate Commons more tightly with Wikidata to improve discovery and to offer contributors and partners better ways of describing and organizing content (see </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2017/01/09/sloan-foundation-structured-data/"><em>here</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data"><em>here</em></a><em>). </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Before we go deeper into your impressions of Commons, can you say a few words about your design philosophy and how you applied it during this assignment?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>There are two main themes in my work that come to bear here:</p>
<p><strong><em>Challenging the dominance of search as primary digital cultural interface</em></strong></p>
<p>Many of the web projects I’ve made recently focus on explorability of gigantic cultural collections. I use the prompt “what happens if there’s no search box?” to help you find things. How can you show the shape and contour of a collection to allow people to follow their nose and sniff out the things that interest them?</p>
<p><strong><em>Importance of copywriting in interface design</em></strong></p>
<p>Wiki systems are always a battle of <strong>Information vs Interface</strong>. The more functional pages you need to use the thing also take the time to explain and define themselves. It can be so <em>informative</em> it’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>Wikis are also written by many. At Flickr, I wrote a lot of the interface copy; the “system voice” was largely mine, and therefore, consistent. On Commons, you don’t know who is telling you what. This opacity can be confusing if you’re expected to follow certain rules, but don’t know who’s setting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: So what did you learn as you delved deeper into Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>It’s huge and arcane. And successful. “Anyone can contribute” means that all sorts do, and there are now about 50 million things there. That’s astonishing.</p>
<p>But, there’s very little sense of the scale or depth of the thing. It’s one thing to say there are all those things that anyone can use, but it’s another to show them all. Newbie explorers are confronted with a vast textual category system including an obscure interface element to show contents of each category… can you tell what it means?</p>
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59317" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electical-engineering-category-screenshot.png?w=323" alt="" width="323" height="383" /></div>
<p><strong><em>Categories are a beautiful disaster</em></strong></p>
<p>The various Wikipedias work so beautifully because they embrace the networked nature of information. Pages are stronger (and accepted) when they interconnect across the system. Wikipedians joke about getting “lost down the rabbit hole”, where you’re at one place at one minute then you look up an hour later and you’re somewhere completely different. This is because all of the entries are deliberately and delicately interconnected.</p>
<p>Commons is not like that. Even though there are about 6 million “<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data/About/FAQ">multi-hierarchichal</a>” categories, the majority of files are only in one category, as this 2017 research shows:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59318"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59318 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SDoC_baseline_-_Number_of_files_by_number_of_categories.png?w=1000" alt="" width="1000" height="600" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you select <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images">Images</a> at the top of the homepage, you see a list of categories of <em>types</em> of image, not <em>types of things</em> in images. That’s tricky if you’re looking for a photo of a flower and not <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_by_resolution">Images by Resolution</a>. There are also Topics on the homepage, which operate a little more like you’d expect. You can click on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, then explore <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chirality_in_mathematics">Chirality in Mathematics</a> or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sets_of_mathematical_objects">Sets of Mathematical Objects</a>. I was able to find what might be the best category in the history of categories though: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Potato_truncated_from_cube_to_predicate_lattice">Potato truncated from cube to predicate lattice</a>. <strong>Does that sound like a category to you?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Showing the actors</strong></em></p>
<p>I was surprised the thousands of people participating aren’t more obvious. Who’s editing what? Which people like which categories? Who is uploading a lot? Who’s helping other people? I became interested in who the admins were, how/when rules were established, and how decisions are made. If we think in terms of locals and tourists, who are the actors who know what’s happening, who I could ask for advice, or imitate?</p>
<p><em><strong>Encouraging description</strong></em></p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59319"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59319 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The_approach_of_the_spirits_.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When you get to a media file, like this fabulous <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22The_approach_of_the_spirits%22.png">The approach of the spirits</a>, there’s nowhere to jump across to; no way to see images like the one you’ve just discovered. Its categories are listed as <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PD-Art_(PD-US-1923)">PD-Art (PD-US-1923)</a> and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Illustrations">Illustrations</a>. Nothing like <em>myth</em>, <em>stories</em>, <em>night</em>, <em>spirits</em>, <em>stars</em>, or <em>the night sky</em>.</p>
<p>Not being able to move sideways is a huge weakness of any hierarchical structure. It can also be difficult to navigate a hierarchy unless you know its whole structure. You’re constantly going into a branch then back out again, instead of skipping across an interconnected collection. That said, the new work on interconnected Commons infoboxes looks really promising, e.g. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:St._Paul%27s_Cathedral">Category:St. Paul’s Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no limit to how many categories a digital object could belong to. How could the system be improved to allow more and different descriptions? As with many traditional cultural collections, an object’s metadata is revisited rarely, so instead of a live database of media like Flickr, where objects enjoy a very social existence, a thinly described object in a sea of 50 million is practically invisible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rules of engagement</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At the start of my wiki-journey, I was left to fend for myself. It felt akin to being surrounded by hungry beasts and wondering why you&#8217;re still alive&#8230;” –</em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pyfan">Pyfan</a></p>
<p>While it’s also easy or almost trite to say that Wikis are transparent democracies where anyone can participate, I also read quite a lot that people feel really intimidated when they first “come to the party”.  The category structure might also have evolved into what’s there today because the rules of engagement are dense, and the interface when you try to add or enhance things is obtuse.</p>
<p>As I did my research, I asked a few questions in the IRC channel, or on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump">Village Pump</a> (which is really well run, by the way). Answers would be presented, and be useful, but, they referenced pages that I bet would have taken me forever to find, if I could find them at all. They often displayed old “votes” or decisions made by a very few, and not revisited, or with no recourse to revisit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any tips and direct feedback for the Wikimedia Commons community?</em></strong></p>
<p>It’s <em>amazing</em>!!</p>
<p>Like I said, I remain interested in the administration of the thing. In this self-governing system, how are rules created? How do those rules percolate to the newbies? How visible are they? And most importantly, who is making them?</p>
<p>There are about 225 admins for 7.2 million accounts on Commons. It’s a media library built by 7 million, but not all are editing and adding things all the time. In fact, the Wikimedia Foundation suggests about <a href="https://stats.wikimedia.org/v2/#/commons.wikimedia.org/contributing/editors/normal%7Cline%7C2-Year%7C~total">32,000 folks a month</a> are active, but even so, the system is administered by just 0.00003% of the population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diversity in administration / representation / arbitration</em></strong></p>
<p>I looked into who the Commons admins are, with the data to hand.[1] Here’s a graph that shows <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">how many admins were brought on each year</a>, and how many from each year “survived” as admins.</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom">
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59320"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59320 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Added-and-surviving-admins.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="630" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I also looked at each admin’s page, and noted whenever I could see a declared gender (using names or photos etc). Here’s the breakdown of admin community demographics:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text" id="attachment_59322"><div class="img-in-text"><img class="wp-image-59322 size-large" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Admin-community-demographics.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="312" /></div><div class="img-caption"><span class="photo-caption"></span> <span class="photo-credit"></span></div></div>
<p>The geographical and language spread of the admins seems pretty good. There are people from different countries, who often also participate in their language Wikipedia and/or the EN Wikipedia, and sometimes even work for, or have worked for, the Foundation. But, even in a best case scenario (where the “unspecified” category from the pie chart was actually about 50/50 women and men, that would still be 66% men and 33% women as declared administrators. There also aren’t many new folks. This might be because the rules of engagement take a while to take in and operate at a sophisticated level. Perhaps it’s also a place to inject diversity, particularly around the things that require some kind of vote or consensus.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note at this point that Hong Kong has a police force of 34,000.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fostering diversity</em></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://seejane.org/about-us/">Geena Davis Research Institute</a> was founded in 2004 to study and shift the balance of representation of women and girls in media. Their tagline is “<em>if she can see it, she can be it</em>,” and the institute has done groundbreaking research about how to measure the presence of women and men in films, mostly, to demonstrate the presence of unconscious bias in our media. The stats are telling.</p>
<p>One of the very simple ways the institute suggests to check when you’re making a movie is that all the crowd scenes contain 50/50 women and men. I really like this. It’s easy to check and simple to do. If we apply this idea to Commons, one place to look for an “equal crowd” is the various Highlights areas, like Photo of the Day, or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Meet_our_photographers">Meet our photographers</a>. Today, those lists are mostly of men, and even some of the older admins.</p>
<p>Those public lists are a place to look for fostering more diverse representation in the community. How could the procedure for creating those lists be realigned with a positive and welcomed diversity agenda?</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing precedents</em></strong></p>
<p>During my research, I was shocked to see a photograph of a naked woman show up on the homepage of Commons, marked as Photo of the Day. I went to the Help Desk to ask “Why is OK to have a picture of a nude woman on the homepage?” I wasn’t crying OMG P0RN!, but suggesting that the image may be an alienating first image for some to encounter. It’s worth <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&amp;oldid=305803393#Why_is_it_OK_to_have_a_picture_of_a_nude_woman_on_the_home_page?">having a read</a> (and a mark of the strength of a wiki’s nature that I can retrieve the conversation). For me, it was telling that the rebuttals to my query ranged from tired responses around “pornography or art”, or that “galleries are full of naked women”, to more more resigned responses like “it’s already been decided”, or, “But this is the Internet, where the opinions of Western young men dominate, so good luck getting any sort of grown-up discussion about that.”</p>
<p>The fact that there the system is full of old decisions that are no longer questioned is a problem. You can see how it’s now handed out as a “it’s the way we’ve always done it” response here, as another helpful person <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Village_pump&amp;oldid=305254391#Objection_to_placement_of_non-notable_naked_recumbent_woman_on_homepage_today">chipped in with support for my query</a>. You can also <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_picture_candidates/File:Fine-art-nudesunpine.jpg">see the original voting process in action, in November 2013</a>, which pushed the photo of the naked woman into the picture of the day category. (Warning: you’ll also see the naked woman on that page.) Of the 18 votes cast, at least 17 of them were by men, 3 of whom were admins, many of whom have been on Commons 5+ years, and a handful of whom are also featured photographers.</p>
<p>I realise that this file and its life on Commons may be an easy target, but, it’s also indicative of the oligarchal participation and representation on Commons.</p>
<p>What if featured photographs votes require a more representative voter group? What if you, as a user, could only have 10 featured photographs? What if the “Featured” lists were removed entirely?</p>

<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the design of Wikimedia Commons in general, to make it easier to use?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>If we’re talking about making it easier to use for individuals using the web interface, then yes, I do.</p>
<p>There are just five user pages and one email in the UI that could be improved to help new folks get grounded. Making them crisp and instructional instead of information vs interface would have a huge effect. It’s about decluttering the copy and trying to help the new person figure out what to do first. The pages are <strong>User</strong>, (and <strong>welcome email</strong>), <strong>User talk</strong>, <strong>Watchlist</strong>, <strong>User contributions</strong>, and <strong>File list</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the current Welcome email, the first point of contact from the Commons to an individual:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi there [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons! Someone (probably you) from IP address 51.148.133.195, has registered an account “[Username]” with your email address here. We’re glad you decided to join us.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>What next? First you should confirm your account.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>To confirm that this account really does belong to you and activate email features on Wikimedia Commons, open this link in your browser:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>After that, you’ll see ideas on how to get started and links to help you learn about Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>From all of us here at Wikimedia Commons, welcome aboard!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>If you did *not* register the account, follow this link to cancel the email address confirmation:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>This confirmation code will expire at 13:53, 13 June 2018.</em></p>
<p>This asks more questions than it answers, and even casts doubt on me being a legitimate user! “Someone (probably you) / “to confirm this account really does belong to you…” come across as defensive and doubtful. Hardly a friendly welcome for someone new.</p>
<p>Have a look at the difference if you make it more concise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Hi [Username],</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Welcome to Wikimedia Commons, the world’s free media library!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Your first step is to confirm your email address, please:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>https://commons.wikimedia.org/Special:ConfirmEmail/EXAMPLE</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Once that’s done, there are a few ways we recommend getting started:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>• Read the Policies and Guidelines of contributing to Wikimedia Commons<br />
</em><em>• Take a Photo Challenge or Upload your first media file<br />
</em><em>• Help improve information about Commons resources<br />
</em><em>• Have a look around your account settings</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><em>Good luck! And if you get stuck, please visit the Community Help Centre.</em></p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that I have absolutely no idea how I—an interested interface designer—could independently contribute effort towards making this part of the system better, just like I can edit regular entries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Seeing each other</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the reasons I think Flickr and other social systems are so successful is because we can <em>see each other </em>when we use them. They show people their own stuff, other people’s stuff, allow them to follow/connect/gather, show the activity happening—<em>particularly on your stuff because we all love that</em>—and often, give a short list of things to try next, to show the way through. We learn from the way other people act and operate in the physical world, and that’s the same on a software platform.</p>
<p>The foundation is there on Commons to enhance representations of scale, activity, and actors to help people see each other more clearly. Improving those five core screens with these themes in mind would help locate new people in the system, and give them only as much information as they need, when they need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: And what about suggestions on how to invite more and better contributions to Commons?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would try to make it much more obvious that viewers can improve metadata; provide much clearer calls to action to interested people. I mean, it’s somewhat implied, given that it’s a Wikimedia system, but, as far as I can tell, the call to action to improve the metadata about a file is a small Edit link next to the Summary heading on the item’s page.</p>
<p>Here’s the Pied-winged swallow, Picture of the Day on 3 September:</p>
<div class="article-img img-in-text">
<div class="img-container mar-bottom"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59358" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-piper-box.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="207" /></div>
</div>
<p>If you have the gumption to click “Edit”, you get this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59326" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pied-winged-swallow-2.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="293" /></p>
<p>So, even if you wanted to add information about the image &#8212; e.g. it’s taken outside, there’s blue sky, it’s a bird, etc &#8212; you have to figure out the editing code/pseudo code and its UI. I tried to add “tag=bird” for example, and it threw an error. It’s very different from having a UI designed specifically to encourage contributions and conversation. It’s not simple. (I realise that “special” images, like Picture of the Day, have protected edit capacity to prevent vandalism.)</p>
<p>There’s a ton of uploading that happens to Commons that&#8217;s not through the UI, but with lots of other tools written to streamline the process. (That’s another strength of the system, and was at Flickr for that matter—that people can contribute to it through all sorts of interfaces.) I found myself wondering if another way to improve contributions to Commons might be to focus on the connective tissue between the various Wikimedia platforms, in the UI. If I upload an image to Commons, I could be actively prompted to create or enhance a Wikipedia page…</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Sandra: Do you have suggestions on how to make Wikimedia Commons a more interesting and useful platform for external organizations (e.g. GLAMs) to work with our communities and make their knowledge available?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I would look at three main areas around usefulness for institutions:</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>Demonstrating use of collections, especially in a digital context, is especially difficult for institutions. If their stuff is nestled cosily amongst about 50 million other things, how and when can they know if the effort they’ve put in to sharing their treasures in the Commons is effective? Can any use of materials be reported on? Can that be established as new, legitimate usage of an institution’s materials? How can it be more refined, or indeed, more accurate than the mysterious “page view”. How can Commons help institutions (and individuals) see when their stuff is used? Something like the old school <a href="https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/21/2008-dopplr-per.html">Dopplr Annual Report</a>, perhaps?</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation and presence</strong></em></p>
<p>As I understand it, institutions either create a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_in_the_Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">category</a> or use <a href="http://zone47.com/crotos/?p195=2817221">a totally different system</a> to see all their media in one place. Can it provide a good destination for institutions to share around? What could their “User” page be like?</p>
<p>If you look at the Wikipedia page for a contributing institution, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum">Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, you see this little box at the bottom:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-59327" src="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nationalmuseum-Stockholm-box.png?w=246" alt="" width="246" height="67" /></p>
<p>Even just rephrasing that to say “Explore the Nationalmuseum Stockholm’s 2,400 contributions to Wikimedia Commons” or perhaps creating another box that does that might be a start. That link also takes me to <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Nationalmuseum_Stockholm">Category:Nationalmuseum Stockholm</a>, but it’s not immediately clear which items are from the collection versus about the institution.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a question about whether institutions should be treated differently in the Commons context. I’m not sure about that. Perhaps it would be better to look for a way to enhance anyone’s presence equally. If part of the claimed benefit of participating in Commons is that metadata may be improved, visibility into the material also needs to be improved. What about a link on the home page to a list that shows all of the institutions?</p>
<p><em><strong>Supporting people doing great stuff</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was doing research, I attended a Wiki-a-thon at the Wellcome Collection in London. It was a day dedicated to improving the presence of women involved in medicine on Wikipedia. There were about eight people in the room, including the Wellcome Wikimedian in Residence, Alice. It was brilliant, and I could not have created my article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Stone">Clara Stone</a> without Alice in the room. The simple act of having a living human who could explain the rules and secret doors (like, you need to make 10 edits before you can make a page) instantly made the whole process more approachable.</p>
<p>Human Wikimedian presence in cultural institutions can really help bridge the gap that’s sometimes perceived between authority and the crowd, which can be difficult for institutions to conquer on their own. This mediation is hugely valuable, and something that the Foundation could continue to support directly, and more. What if there was a Wikimedian in Residence at every national library in the world? (And lots of the smaller ones too?!?)</p>
<p>I was also surprised to discover that lots of the updates to Commons are done en masse, through scripts and other programmes developed by volunteers. What sorts of other support could the Foundation provide for these folks? How can it support this developer community even more than it does now? What new efforts and resources can be amplified to reach more potential users (both outside and within GLAMs)?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">———</p>
<p><strong><em>Ben: Any last thoughts on what a community-driven media repository like Wikimedia Commons could become in the future?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>George: </strong>I was a bit surprised that this work turned out to be about representation in the end. Yes, there are simple interface changes that could be made to continue to improve usability, but there’s a huge challenge for Commons (and other huge collections online like Europeana and DPLA) to improve description of their millions of things so they’re easier to see.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">just seen in the United States</a>, oligarchies don’t like change and giving up control, but what if <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385">diversity trumps ability</a>?</p>
<p>These vast online collections will eventually see a return of the power and delicacy of curation. Only machines can consume 50 million things, and even then they might not be sure exactly what those things are, and if they find something interesting they won’t know who to tell. Computers “<a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/discovery/homo-faber">scan everything and hear nothing</a>,” so we need all kinds of humans from all over the world to help gather our histories into meaningful units, but right now, Commons is a pretty closed system.</p>
<p>Imagine if Commons could become like one of the great old cities of the world, full of all kinds of people from all kinds of places instead of a big city run by a tiny group of people who basically look the same?</p>

<p>[1] The admin data consists of two views: (1) The list on the right side of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators">Commons:Administrators</a> page, and (2) those users listed on the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful_requests_for_adminship">Commons:Administrators/Archive/Successful requests for adminship</a>, which I edited manually to separate users who’d ever been admins from those who remain admins. Note that the total count of admins in those two views differs: (1) 225 admins, and (2) 472. I decided (2) is the more useful, but it should be stated that that’s a manually maintained list, and possibly not accurate.</p>

        <p>Every year, the <a href="https://www.dotrust.org/">Digital Opportunity Trust</a> (DOT) hosts the Unconference &#8211; a participant-led event that convenes young social innovators hailing from several of the organization’s network countries. The Unconference grants youths the opportunity to connect with professionals, mentors, and one another, bringing over 100 individuals from several countries to share their innovation experiences. From Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Indigenous Canada, DOT works with governments, the private sector and community-based organizations to support youth striving to transform their societies as social innovators, digital ambassadors, and leaders.</p>
<p>This year, the conference was held in Nairobi, Kenya and centered around the theme of inclusivity &#8211; specifically, closing the gender gap in technology. The first morning plenary session was opened by DOT CEO and founder, Janet Longmore, who spoke on the rise of social entrepreneurship, innovation and business. “Think about how you can contribute in the world of humanity, because the challenge we face cannot be solved with one or two individuals,” Longmore said. “A way to truly create an inclusive world is through passion, skill, and talent of social innovators.”</p>
<p>And passionate, talented social innovators we met! DIAL had the privilege to learn about several individuals and their journeys to create and apply digital solutions to achieve positive social change in their communities. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelChatina">Emmanuel Chatina</a> has developed a social enterprise that leverages mobile phones to offer remote healthcare to those who would otherwise not have ready access to health providers.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356904" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Others are addressing the invisible form of health and seek to destigmatize dialogue surrounding it. Eunice Njeghe, Angela Mumbi, Walder Amani, and Latifa Noor promote mental health and connect individuals in Kenya to mental health providers through their mobile application, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeingPsych">PsychBeing</a>, while Yvonne Osagie from Ottawa is currently developing an online platform devoted to education, support, and prevention of sexual abuse on college campuses.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356951" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297356989" width="350" height="300" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>And digital technologies are not only being used, but taught: in addition to training young girls and women in the latest technologies, Ivy Barley, co-founder of <a href="https://developersinvogue.org/">Developers in Vogue</a>, helps them navigate the tech space and connects them to real-time projects and jobs, doing her part in closing the gender divide in tech.</p>
<p>As we learned about the different ways in which digital technology extends social services to traditionally underserved communities across multiple geographies and sectors, we also had the opportunity to introduce many of the participants to the <a href="digitalprinciples.org">Digital Principles</a> and share how the Principles can help guide their work and achieve sustainability. Participants who attended our Digital Principles session shared the challenges they face when implementing their solutions, the resources they wish they had available, and how they believed the Principles could be helpful in addressing these issues. Many insights shared by participants showcased common problems in the ICT sector and demonstrated how it is never too early to begin putting the Principles into practice.</p>
<p>The Unconference was an incredibly powerful and inspiring experience; we look forward to having DOT youths’ voices join and help shape the future of the Digital Principles as they continue to develop into tomorrow’s innovators and leaders bringing digital solutions to global communities.</p>

        <p>When you think about the work of art historians or genetics researchers, installing database software is not the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, from 19 to 21 September, Wikimedians, art curators, and scientists <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2018-09-19-21-New-York">gathered at the New Museum</a> in New York City’s Lower East Side for a three-day workshop to talk about an emerging technology designed to make storing and structuring data free and accessible. The focal point was an increasingly vital piece of the Wikimedia ecosystem that makes linked data possible for everyone: Wikibase.</p>
<p>Wikibase is a little-known standalone piece of software that powers Wikimedia’s popular new linked-data project <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>.  (This is similar to how Wikipedia is powered by a general wiki software called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, which is used everywhere from NASA to MuppetWiki.)  Since 2012, Wikidata has been growing to fill an increasingly important role in the Wikimedia community: connecting, sharing and providing tools for turning Wikipedia’s text strings into useful, searchable, machine-readable.  Wikidata’s content informs research and cultural heritage institutions, as well as digital tools like Google’s Knowledge Graph. None of this would be possible without Wikibase—which makes the Wikidata’s linked open data project possible and practical.</p>
<p>In the last few years, an expanding community of researchers, GLAMs, and other knowledge communities have been experimenting with using Wikibase for their own repositories of knowledge, distinct from the central Wikidata knowledge collected by Wikimedians. But this nascent community of Wikibase reusers is just emerging, and deploying an open source technology not originally designed for third-party use can be challenging.</p>
<p>The September Wikidata workshop gathered a subgroup of these pioneering data explorers to better understand how to realize Wikibase as a robust independent project distinct from the Wikidata platform, and to turn it into a tool that can offer core infrastructure for the work of scholars and GLAMs as they collect, describe and analyze their diverse stores of both facts and artifacts.  The key question: how could Wikibase reach and meet the needs of professionals across a broad community of emerging and established institutions.</p>
<p>The gathering was made possible through a generous grant by the Sloan Foundation.  It was hosted and sponsored by one of the early adopters of this technology, <a href="http://rhizome.org">Rhizome</a> (documented in our Many Faces of Wikibase <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">blog series</a>), and co-organized with <a href="https://wikimedia.de/en">Wikimedia Germany (Deutschland)</a>.</p>
<h3>What do you talk about in a Wikibase workshop?</h3>
<p>The Wikibase workshop began with talks by participants highlighting their work in the realms of Wikidata, Wikibase, and more generally representing and working with linked data. Participants came with varying levels of experience with Wikidata and Wikibase, from interested newcomers to intrepid early adopters of the technology.  So, the presentations created an important baseline understanding of what is happening with Wikibase and what its possibilities and pain points are.</p>
<p>Day one explored both the many opportunities and the number of underlying concerns exploring and integrating a new technology. Are we the only ones experiencing challenges? Are there tools that could help us solve our problems? What kind of future can we build for increasing adoption of the software?</p>
<p>At the same time presenters brought striking examples of advanced use.  Digital art specialists described how they use Wikimedia tools for art preservation <em>Rhizome </em><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/">using Wikibase</a>, and <em>SFMOMA</em> using Mediawiki. Michigan State University’s <a href="http://enslaved.org/">Enslaved.org</a> and Pratt University’s <a href="https://linkedjazz.org/">Linked Jazz Project</a> showed off the <a href="https://medium.com/@thisismattmiller/wikibase-for-research-infrastructure-part-1-d3f640dfad34">power of wikibase and linked data for exploring the cultural record</a>.  GLAM professionals from the Smithsonian, New York’s METRO library consortium, and York University highlighted the potential applications of Wikidata to their own varied and vast collections spaces.</p>
<p>During the second day, we broke into working groups focused on understanding practical ways which Wikibase can be better supported for arts and research communities. Tracks focused on UI/UX improvements, making Wikibase easier to install and use, developing a Wikibase community, improving data modeling on Wikibase. The groups each provided <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/s/LOD-Wikibase-Summit-NYC">pages of documentation and specific recommendations</a> that can be used as part of Wikibase’s development going forward (including, for example, <a href="https://notepad.rhizome.org/zMnfc5tPTwa8ajcUiTzPQA?both">concept sketches</a> for changes to the platform that would help GLAM and humanities researchers use Wikibase).</p>
<p>By day three, the community in the room had a strong sense of solidarity and shared purpose: that we can imagine are future in which Wikibase powers GLAM and research institutions to strengthen the exchange and connection of knowledge. We wrapped up the workshop with a session of sharing and reflecting, and then finished documenting the event, with next steps and links to notes on the conference meetup page, technical feature requests on phabricator tickets, and this very blog post.</p>
<h3>It’s more than just gathering together—it’s about creating a community</h3>
<p>An overwhelming theme throughout the workshop was the questions of, <em>what’s next</em>? In the wrapup conversations, the answers came back to facilitating a growing community of users who want to apply the Wikibase technology to the work of researchers and GLAMs. Key to forming the community would be figuring out what stories we can tell, and how we can tell them to new audiences.</p>
<p>Most of the participants in the New York Workshop were new users of Wikibase—very much still learning. In a community-driven environment like Wikimedia, sometimes the best outcome of an event is developing a larger community of knowledge-holders, of individuals able to explain, support and facilitate understanding of a practice or set of projects. With the Wikibase workshop, we helped a larger group of community members share their knowledge and gain knowledge from others. So, the next time a question arises on the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikibaseug">Wikibase users mailing list</a>, or a colleague expresses as interest in Wikibase, they know who else to connect with. In short: the workshop helped produce more nodes in our growing Wikibase linked data network.</p>
<p>This budding community would not have been able to form without the amazing facilitation of Dragan Espenschied (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111053">Q111053</a> on Wikidata) from Rhizome and Sandra Müllrick from Wikimedia Deutschland, along with their teams.  The organizers facilitated a collegial, knowledge exchange that can lead to a growing web of Wikibase users and community participants.</p>

Per aquest motiu, està dissenyat per facilitar-los la iniciació mitjançant un conjunt de tasques, que proveeixen organitzacions com el Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic. Els preuniversitaris seleccionen les tasques i les treballen amb l’ajut d’un mentor durant vàries setmanes. Cada tasca té una durada de 3 a 5 hores i els estudiants disposen de 3 dies per acabar-la i després, si ho volen, continuar amb una de nova.<br /><br />Les tasques són de 5 tipus diferents i no únicament de programació, la qual cosa amplia a tots els escolars la possibilitat de presentar-s’hi. Al tractar-se d’un programa mundial, totes les preguntes, respostes i comunicacions es fan en anglès.<br /><br /><img height="139" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1WhH2ptYnjIoseZjQKliUhEftPNqsmIIrjRYsfoPn5ANAoi3daUCEBdJwUp4oC2_viPu7a1v20kvOg5GiL39l_EzdL6eN_9bzHuho5OknZR4zCfvodIPJd4gOypZqEvA_K_oPS-C" width="640" /><br /><br />El concurs està dotat amb diversos premis, que depenen del nombre de tasques que finalitzin i de quantes en facin els estudiants: des de diplomes de Google (1 tasca), samarretes (3 o més tasques), assuadores ii, fins i tot, guanyar un viatge a la central de Google, situada a Silicon Valley (Califòrnia), amb un familiar o tutor.<br /><br />Des del 2010, més de 4.500 estudiants de 99 països han participat en el programa Google Code-in. El Liquid Galaxy LAB del Parc Científic va gestionar el passat concurs 2017-2018 més de 500 estudiants de tot el món, entre els quals hi havia vàries dotzenes de lleidatans.<br /><br /><br /><b>Objectius </b>Que nenes i nens de Lleida i arreu del mòn aconsegueixin una experiència mundial única i amb una marca tan reconeguda com Google mitjançant la participació en aquesta nova edició. El Parc Científic, a través del seu laboratori Liquid Galaxy LAB, és un dels dissenyadors del programa. <br /><br /><b>Dates </b>El proper 23 d’octubre comença el termini per registrar-se i seleccionar les tasques a desenvolupar a través de la web <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">https://codein.withgoogle.com/</a>. <br />El concurs finalitza el 12 de desembre del 2018. Els estudiants necessiten un compte de Google per accedir-hi i un permís parental, que se’ls demana al registrar-se. Els participants han d’esperar que Google aprovi el permís abans de desenvolupar les tasques.<br /><br /><br /><b>Responsables </b>El Liquid Galaxy LAB, laboratori TIC del Parc Científic sota la coordinació d’Andreu Ibáñez i amb la col·laboració del Grup de Desenvolupadors Google de Lleida (GDG Lleida). Darrera hi ha un equip de 30 mentors de tot el món, que atenen els estudiants.<br /><br /><b>Contacte: lgcodein@gmail.com </b>

      <h5>2018-10-18T17:00:39.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Melody Kramer</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The news that optical physicist Donna Strickland <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/10/04/donna-strickland-wikipedia/">did not have a Wikipedia page</a> before winning the Nobel Prize in Physics brought renewed attention to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">Women in Red</a>, a long-standing volunteer effort to add more biographies about women to the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After the announcement, the Women in Red WikiProject had one of their best weeks ever, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_Stephenson-Goodknight">Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight</a>, the co-founder of Women in Red.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://denelezh.dicare.org/evolution.php?project=enwiki">Statistics [&#8230;] show</a> an increase in the number of women’s biographies during the week immediately after the Nobel Prize announcement,” she said. “I’ve also seen a dramatic increase [in interest] on social media.”</p>
<p>The news that more people are interested in contributing biographies about women to Wikipedia is gratifying to Stephenson-Goodnight, who co-founded Women in Red in 2015 after learning that only 15 percent of biographies on Wikipedia at the time were about women. (That number has since jumped to 17.67 percent, meaning an average of 72 new articles on women were added to English Wikipedia every single day for the past 3.5 years.)</p>
<p>In the past three years, Women in Red has collaborated with outside institutions like museums and libraries that want to put on edit-a-thons, and developed lists of “redlinks”—non-existing Wikipedia articles—of women who should have material written about them. But the group doesn’t stop at biographies.</p>
<p>“Our scope includes women&#8217;s works (such as the paintings they painted, the schools the founded, the conferences they convened), as well as women&#8217;s issues (such as women&#8217;s suffrage and women&#8217;s health),” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>A helpful space for newcomers</h3>
<p>Women in Red is known for helping newcomers navigate the technical rules of Wikipedia—which can be overwhelming for new contributors. Sue Barnum, a volunteer Librarian-in-Residence with Women in Red, points to the group’s friendly and helpful nature as a key reason why it has been so successful.</p>
<p>“We support one another and help each other with our articles, references and technical details. If you need help, we&#8217;re going to help or find someone who can,” she says. “I&#8217;ll try to help people get access to articles or books behind paywalls. Sometimes I&#8217;ll even go to nearby libraries to access the actual book to help people verify their sources if the book or journal is only available offline.”</p>
<h3>The focus is on why women matter</h3>
<p>Editor SusunW, a founding member of Women in Red, recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-05-24/Blog">wrote an essay</a> about why she focuses on writing about women on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“I learn as much from writing women’s biographies as I impart from telling their stories,” she writes. “For example, in the pre-internet world, the international links between people and the organizations in which they participated were much stronger than you might imagine. The analytical part of researching the interconnections, and reward of working with editors who want to improve articles, is a motivating factor to me—as is the hope that the women in generations who follow will grow up knowing that women have always been actively involved in the world around them and were not passively allowing the world to go by.”</p>
<p>Making women—and their role in history—more visible is a motivating factor for many participants to Women in Red.</p>
<p>“I grew up believing that women didn&#8217;t do anything interesting,” says Barnum. “It&#8217;s sad that I believed that, because it isn&#8217;t true. I believed this because women&#8217;s contributions become invisible, especially after their deaths. There are many articles I&#8217;ve worked on where a woman was quite nationally famous during her lifetime, but after she dies, she somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; to make it into the canon that describes the subject she was involved in. This is really tragic and I&#8217;m glad that there are historians out there writing about women who have been hidden in history.”</p>
<p><strong>You can make a difference</strong></p>
<p>Inspired to join Women in Red?  There are many ways to get involved. For starters, Women in Red has put together a p<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Primer_for_creating_women%27s_biographies">rimer for creating women&#8217;s biographies&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Essays/Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Women_in_Red">&#8220;ten Simple Rules for Creating Women&#8217;s Biographies&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to jump in, Barnum recommends starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Redlist_index">the lists</a> that Women in Red has put together on women that are notable by Wikipedia’s standards and who need biographies written about them.</p>
<p>“Pick someone from a subject area you enjoy writing about and then make sure you have several reliable sources to backup your writing,” she says.</p>
<p>SusunW adds that you don’t necessarily need to start with a full biography. “If there do not appear to be sufficient sources to add a standalone biography on a woman, she can be added to events she participated in and organizations she was involved with, provided reliable sourcing can confirm her activities.”</p>
<p>For example, if a woman participated in an academic conference, adding her name to the list of participants—with proper sourcing—may help someone write a biography about her at a later date.</p>
<p>And Stephenson-Goodnight says you can always update an existing article. “Add a reference, add an internal link to another article, fix the punctuation, or improve the opening paragraph,” she says.</p>
<h3>If you need help</h3>
<p>Don’t be overwhelmed if you start to edit and find yourself confused. There are many ways to get help! You can post on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Women_in_Red">talk page of  Women in Red</a>, as well as the talk pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rosiestep">Rosie</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Megalibrarygirl">Sue</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SusunW">SusunW</a>. (A talk page is like a message board where people communicate about a topic or article.)</p>
<p>“If you get stuck or have questions, remember that all of us were new once and others helped us, so we&#8217;re glad to respond to your questions,” says Stephenson-Goodnight. “You can also reach me via Twitter or Facebook or email.”</p>
<p>And if you’d rather work with people in person, there are opportunities for that too.</p>
<p>“If you live near a city which has a Wikimedia Affiliate (Chapter, Thematic Organization, or User Group), check in with them regarding their events schedule. There&#8217;s an international list available on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup">this Meetup page</a>. Or ask us at Women in Red to assist you in the search,” says Stephenson-Goodnight.</p>
<h3>Helping beyond editing</h3>
<p>And one last thing: you don’t need to edit Wikipedia to meaningfully contribute to Women in Red. You can tweet or post about new articles on social media (including the handle <a href="https://twitter.com/wikiwomeninred">@WikiWomenInRed</a>), help find archival material, or help access photos that are licensed properly.</p>
<p>“Having people who are willing to reach out to individuals to secure a license for a picture to be used on Commons is very helpful,” says Barnum. “Others may have access to archives or books that are offline and can help provide access to other editors.”</p>
<p>And your work—whether an edit, a tweet, or a photo—is meaningful, and makes a difference <em>on </em>Wikipedia.</p>
<p>“We are making a difference, one article at a time, making for incremental corrections to the systemic bias depicted in the written canon,” says Stephenson-Goodknight. “I can&#8217;t imagine doing anything more worthwhile with my free time.”</p>

What building blocks need to be in place to leverage mobile phone network data for real-time policy analysis, decision making and impact tracking? UN Global Pulse and the Digital Impact Alliance are excited to host a joint-session at the UN World Data Forum in Dubai to explore the operational aspects of using mobile phone network data as a public good. At the event, we are bringing various actors from government, UN Agencies, Mobile Network Operators and NGOs to share their research and on-the-ground experience of using mobile network data to inform decision making around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for humanitarian action.</p>
<p>With more than 5 billion people connected to mobile services in 2017 and projections of reaching 5.9 billion by 2025, or 71 per cent of the world’s population, the mobile phone sector has become increasingly important in helping achieve the SDGs. While the mobile industry has made great strides in supporting the SDGs, we are still far from realizing its full impact. A critical piece of the mobile industry’s impact lies in the data it generates for analysis, which governments, humanitarian and development organizations, and donors agree would be extremely beneficial to address key humanitarian issues and reach the SDGs by 2030.</p>
<p>Anonymised mobile network data contains information about population characteristics such as movements, density, location, social patterns, and finances. As this data is uniquely detailed and tractable, it can capture information not easily found from other sources at a scale that would be difficult to recreate through other means. Once anonymized and aggregated to appropriate levels, this data can provide a variety of insights with tremendous value for development partners, including but not limited to mobility, social interaction, and economic activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unglobalpulse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Pulse</a> has developed a series of proof-of-concepts for the use of mobile network data for public good, including tracking food security, informing disaster management and understanding seasonal migration, among others. We’re working not only with mobile operators around the world, but also with their industry trade organization, the GSMA. In 2017, GSMA established an explicit strategy around putting anonymiszed mobile big data to work for the public good. There are currently 19 mobile operators who are committed to the Big Data for Social Good initiative. This is exciting for us because it shows how data philanthropy could work at an industry-wide scale, rather than with just one partner at a time.</p>
<p>We also strive to catalyse the use of big data for public policy and humanitarian action by advancing normative frameworks and delivering learning experiences for policy makers across the world via our network of labs. At the World Data Forum, we hope to showcase some of our work in the South Pacific with Digicel and the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, informing responses to natural disasters in these contexts and shaping our thinking on how to scale this work, as well as share the experiences of our colleagues at ITU who are using mobile network data to better understand the development of information societies.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/what-we-do/data-for-development-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DIAL’s Data for Development</a> portfolio focuses on unlocking the value of private sector data (including mobile network data) in a safe, standardized manner, utilizing technical, commercial and governance-driven innovation to help achieve impact and sustainability. DIAL is working with a global network of partners including country governments, mobile network operators, technology solutions providers, donors and implementation organizations to support the building and scaling of data-driven solutions to meet the SDGs. DIAL also provides capital and operational support for development and deployment of reusable digital building blocks (e.g. software platforms, data analytics tools) that are designed once but that can be tailored to fit unique sectoral and geographical needs. This October, DIAL will share updates and key learnings from our work in Uganda and Malawi, our platform investments, and from global research by inviting our key partners to share their experiences. While each of these projects has been different in terms of focus and lessons learnt, we’ve also identified high-level synthesis items at the ecosystem level, which are helping us understand what is needed to bring the use of mobile data to scale.</p>
<p>UNGP and DIAL are excited to co-host this panel given the overlap of our work and the recognition that in order to scale and sustain the use of mobile network data, we must share what we’ve learned so far and increase collaborative efforts. The UN World Data Forum provides a great opportunity to elevate the conversation so that we, as a data community, can work together to make the use of mobile network data more systemic and sustainable.</p>
<p>We hope you join our session and bring forth your ideas so that we can further develop practices and models that safely and responsibly use mobile data for public good.</p>

Making graphs is easy. Making intuitive, easy-to-understand graphs? It&#8217;s harder than most people think. At the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, the ISTE-260 (Designing the User Experience) course teaches the language of design to IT students. For an introductory exercise in the class, students are tasked to visualize any set of data they desire. Students <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidkim18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Kim</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jathan-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jathan Anandham</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinwflory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin W. Flory</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-tinker-216962129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Tinker</a> used the MusicBrainz database to look at how five different Queen songs went mainstream in different ways.




<span id="more-7209"></span>



<h2>Five factors of Queen</h2>




Our mini data science experiment decided to look at five unique data points available to us via <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz Works</a>:




<ul>
 	<li>Number of recorded covers</li>
 	<li>Number of artists who covered a song</li>
 	<li>Release year</li>
 	<li>Year of last recorded cover</li>
 	<li>Time elapsed between release year and year of last recorded cover</li>
</ul>




Originally, we looked at songs from different artists, but decided to look at five recordings from the same artist. With Queen being a notoriously famous band, there were several data points to work with in terms of how often a song was covered.

<h2>Making sense of the data</h2>




A few explanations are necessary for some of the data, especially the difference in number of covers and number of artists. <em>Don&#8217;t Stop Me Now</em>, <em>Fat Bottomed Girls</em>, and <em>We Will Rock You</em> had the same number of recorded covers as number of artists who have covered the song. Why were <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> and <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> different?





As it turns out, <em>Another One Bites the Dust</em> had more covers than the number of artists who have covered the song. This happens because some artists have covered the song twice (e.g. once on a studio release and another on a live recording release). On the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody had more artists covering it than number of covers because some recordings featured multiple artists on the same cover (e.g. the 1992 live performance with Elton John and Axl Rose).





The data opens many interesting questions. Why have some songs persisted longer than others (in terms of recent covers)? Have these songs impacted culture and society in different ways? How have they permeated culture? Is there geographical bias in the data?





This exercise was an exploratory assignment, but we had fun visualizing it and ended up learning an interesting pattern in music data.

      <h5>2018-10-11T08:00:58.000Z</h5>
      <i class="author">Justin W. Flory</i>
      <div class="content">
        <p>One of the first rites of passage when working on a new project is creating your development environment. It always seems simple, but sometimes there are bumps along the way. The first activity I did to begin contributing to ListenBrainz was create my development environment. I wasn&#8217;t successful with the documentation in the README, so I had to play around and work with the project before I was even running it.</p>
<p>The first part of this post details how to set up your own development environment. Then, the second half talks about the solution I came up with and my first contribution back to the project.</p>
<p><span id="more-6920"></span></p>
<h2>Install dependencies: Docker</h2>
<p>This tutorial assumes you are using a Linux distribution. If you&#8217;re using a different operating system, install the necessary dependencies or packages with your preferred method.</p>
<p>ListenBrainz ships in Docker containers, which helps create your development environment and later deploy the application. Therefore, to work on the project, you need to install Docker and use containers for building the project. Containers save you from installing all of this on your own workstation!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m using Fedora, I run this command.</p>
<pre>sudo dnf install docker docker-compose</pre>
<h2>Register a MusicBrainz application</h2>
<p>Next, you need to register your application and get a OAuth token from MusicBrainz. Using the OAuth token lets you sign into your development environment with your MusicBrainz account. Then, you can import your plays from somewhere else.</p>
<p>To register, visit the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicBrainz applications page</a>. There, look for the option to <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register your application</a>. Fill out the form with these three options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: (any name you want and will recognize, I used <code>listenbrainz-server-devel</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>Web Application</code></li>
<li><strong>Callback URL</strong>: <code><a href="http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post</a></code></li>
</ul>
<p>After entering this information, you&#8217;ll have a OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret. You&#8217;ll use these for configuring ListenBrainz.</p>
<h4>Update config.py</h4>
<p>With your new client ID and secret, update the ListenBrainz configuration file. If this is your first time configuring ListenBrainz, copy the sample to a live configuration.</p>
<pre>cp listenbrainz/config.py.sample listenbrainz/config.py</pre>
<p>Next, open the file with your favorite text editor and look for this section.</p>
<pre># MusicBrainz OAuth
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID"
MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET"</pre>
<p>Update the strings with your client ID and secret. After doing this, your ListenBrainz development environment is able to authenticate and log in from your MusicBrainz login.</p>
<h2>Initialize ListenBrainz databases</h2>
<p>Your development environment needs some databases present to work. Before proceeding, run these three commands to initialize the databases.</p>
<pre>docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_msb_db --create-db
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_influx</pre>
<p>Your development environment is now ready. Now, let&#8217;s actually see ListenBrainz load locally!</p>
<h2>Run the magic script</h2>
<p>Once you have done this, run the <code>develop.sh</code> script in the root of the repository. Using <code>docker-compose</code>, the script creates multiple Docker containers for the different services and parts of the ListenBrainz server. Running this script will start Redis, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and web server containers, to name a few. But this also makes it easy to stop them all later.</p>
<pre>./develop.sh</pre>
<p>You will see the containers build and eventually run. Leave the script running to see your development environment. Later, you can shut it down by pressing <code>CTRL^C</code>. Once everything is running, visit your new site from your browser!</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost/</a></p>
<p>Now, you are all set to begin making changes and testing them in your development environment!</p>
<h2>Making my first pull request</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, my first attempt at a development environment was unsuccessful. My system kept denying permission to the processes in the containers. After looking at system audit logs and running a temporary <code>setenforce 0</code>, I tried the script one more time. Everything suddenly worked! So the issue was mostly with SELinux.</p>
<p>With my goal to get my environment set up, I figured out a few issues with the configuration offered by the project developers. I eventually made <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PR #257</a> against <code>listenbrainz-server</code> with my improvements.</p>
<h4>Labeling SELinux volume mounts</h4>
<p>To diagnose the issue, I started with a quick search and found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24288616/permission-denied-on-accessing-host-directory-in-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow question</a> with my same problem. There, the question was about Docker containers and denied permissions in the container. The answers explained it was an SELinux error and the context for the containers was not set. However, temporarily changing context for a directory didn&#8217;t seem too effective and doesn&#8217;t persist across reboots.</p>
<p>Continuing the search, I found an issue filed against <code>docker-compose</code> about the <code>:z</code> and <code>:Z</code> flags for volume mounts. These flags set SELinux context for containers, with the best explanation I found coming from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35222815/2497452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two suffixes :z or :Z can be added to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The &#8216;z&#8217; option tells Docker that the volume content will be shared between containers. Docker will label the content with a shared content label. Shared volumes labels allow all containers to read/write content. The &#8216;Z&#8217; option tells Docker to label the content with a private unshared label.</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I added the <code>:z</code> flag to all the volume mounts in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. I submitted a fix upstream for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listenbrainz-server#257</a>!</p>
<h4>Correct the startup port</h4>
<p>In the README, it says the server will start on port 8000, but the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file actually started the server on port 80. I included a fix for this in <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/pull/257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my pull request</a> as well.</p>
<h2>git push!</h2>
<p>This post makes a debugging experience that actually took hours look like it happened in minutes. But after getting over this hurdle, it was awesome to finally see ListenBrainz running locally on my workstation. It was an even better feeling when I could take my improvements and send them back in a pull request to ListenBrainz. Hopefully this will make it easier for others to create their own development environments and start hacking!</p>

        <p class="article-date">NEW YORK, NY &#8211; Partners call on countries to take whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technologies.</p>
<p class="article-date">The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released a global call to action today, inviting governments, donors, technology vendors and other stakeholders to adopt a whole-of-government approach to investing in digital technology. The call to action builds upon a new Digital Investment Framework that DIAL and ITU have developed for global stakeholders which identifies digital technologies that are most important to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The launch of this new SDG Digital Investment Framework is the first step in DIAL and ITU’s ongoing collaboration. The Framework examined use cases in agriculture, education and the health sector and identifies a set of common, reusable ICT building blocks. For example, a few of the building blocks relate to identification, messaging and payment systems, all which can be reused across multiple development sectors. Investing in reusable ICT building blocks – like India and Estonia have approached their e-governance efforts – has been proven to increase efficiency, deliver a higher ROI for governments and create a platform-based ecosystem that attracts a higher volume of application providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“The Framework reinforces our commitment to breaking down barriers and looking for ways to institutionalize digital technology into development services,” said Kate Wilson, CEO, Digital Impact Alliance. “While this is our first joint initiative with ITU, we look forward to our continued work to help governments, the private sector, and donors make smarter and more strategic investments in digital technology to realize their potential to deliver SDG services to anyone, anywhere, at any time.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DIAL and ITU are inviting the development community to support a whole-of-government approach to deploying integrated digital services to achieve the SDGs. Whole-of-government refers to an approach whereby governments look across all sectors and organizations when considering how to invest in ICT infrastructure in an integrated and coordinated manner. Taking this holistic view helps countries realize economies of scale that are not possible when ICT is implemented in a piecemeal fashion. DIAL and ITU have proposed specific calls to action for governments, donors and technology implementers to use this approach and in return have outlined specific support the partners will provide to others.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Information and communication technologies are a key platform for development and a powerful tool to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, says Brahima Sanou, Director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau. “This Framework is an important tool to help policy makers and donors to identify and direct funds to more efficient and effective ICT investments that will ensure no one is left behind.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SDG commitments made by 193 countries were set to “transform our world” by 2030. Countries’ ability to achieve this goal is dependent on innovative uses of ICT services that can make existing programs more effective and scalable to better serve their population.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">“Despite billions of dollars invested over the last decade to integrate programs and digital technology, the development community has yet to see software providers creating applications to support the SDGs because investments are often siloed by sector, address a very small target audience and are designed for the short term,” said Jonathan Payne, Senior Policy Advisor at DIAL. &#8220;The SDG Digital Investment Framework and whole-of-government approach address these issues by fostering reusable ICT building blocks that can be implemented across multiple sectors to meet diverse development needs.”</p>

        <p>At the end of the last version I was getting into the groove—and feeling determined.<br />
I had managed to vittle down the instrument backlog to half! I though surely I could do even better! Let&#8217;s start digging into the meat of things and, get serious.</p>
<p>Now we were going to do things seriously, so therefore this was a pretty big version!<br />
It&#8217;s called:</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s get serious!</h3>
<p>I started by looking into a few issues during autumn:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/INST-517">INST-517</a>] &#8211; double bass relations</li>
<li>[<a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/INST-519">INST-519</a>] &#8211; viola d&#8217;amore relations</li>

<li>[<a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/INST-161">INST-161</a>] &#8211; Ney (closed as invalid)</li>
</ul>
<p>However right in the middle of this version came <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/"><abbr title="Google Code‐in">GCI</abbr></a>!<br />
I was part of the contest as a mentor this year (for the first time) so naturally I had some instrument tasks ready for our participants. They were pretty popular, with a lot of tickets being added or improved by the participants. So, this is how serious we got for GCI:</p>

</ul>
<p>The majority of these where done during autumn &#8217;17 and the first half of &#8217;18. The whole thing would have been finished in the summer, hadn&#8217;t May, June and July &#8217;18 been <a href="https://www.yr.no/artikkel/_-fleire-stadar-vil-nok-fa-34-grader_-1.14140919">the hottest summer</a> <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/record-breaking-heat-hits-norway-finland-and-sweden-20180718-p4zs3x.html">ever</a>! I just couldn&#8217;t think, so I took a break until August and then I finished dealing with the last few stragglers.</p>
<p>This version ended up including 58 tickets: the largest to date!<br />
What happens now? Well, at the end of the &#8220;Let&#8217;s get serious&#8221; version I noticed some issues with families and the like, but that&#8217;s a topic for the next blog post!</p>

<p>It&#8217;d been almost 2 years since I started, and I&#8217;ve managed to get quite a lot done! Here is a graph that illustrates the progress (notice the the jump in added tickets during GCI period, when the participants actually added them faster than I could close them!):<br />

        <p>To celebrate today’s International Day of Peace, Zach Tilton, evaluation specialist for the Digital Impact Alliance, reflects on his time working in peacetech and his career journey to leverage technology for peace and development.</p>
<p>As a young child, I remember sitting on my dad’s lap watching the green and black interface of the MS-DOS screen start up, hearing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvr9AMWEU-c">dial-up modem handshake</a> cacophonies as my mom logged on to the internet, and intercepting secret love-note faxes between my sister and her boyfriend. My father was an IT worker, my mother a technology specialist, and my older sister has since dumped the fax (and boyfriend) and now works in Big Tech. While technology runs in my family and has impacted my life beyond fond memories, this past summer I joined another digitally-literate family, the <a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/">Digital Impact Alliance</a>, to help tech have a lasting impact on the lives of others. This post highlights how my experiences with digital development and peacetech underscore why I believe in DIAL’s mission.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth in digital development in 2011, when I helped build and manage an online course for advanced mediation skills during my <a href="https://davidomckaycenter.com/#mckay-center">undergraduate peacebuilding program</a>. During a mediation role-play with some students based in Fiji, who had experienced two coups d&#8217;état in the previous decade, I was struck by the role technology was playing in delivering critical services to underserved populations. Years later as <a href="https://www.peacecorps.gov/morocco/">Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco</a>, I led an monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) task force to utilize higher rates of mobile devices in the field (85 percent from 57 percent in the previous cohort) to test mobile data collection methods and hold program-wide conversations about improving cultures of accountability and learning.</p>
<p>I eventually connected with <a href="https://howtobuildup.org/">Build Up</a>, a social enterprise that convenes peacebuilders, technologists, and artists, and works on <a href="https://www.stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.cv/">peacetech</a> related initiatives. Aside from volunteering and presenting at their annual <a href="https://howtobuildpeace.org/">Build Peace </a>conferences over the years, I recently worked on two peacetech projects: a <a href="https://peacehack.io/2017/09/12/peacehackldn2017-robotsforpeace/">#peacehack</a> where participants built Twitter bots to amplify the message of International Peace Day and a <a href="https://medium.com/@howtobuildup/building-the-commons-dc60e6ee7b69">campaign</a> following the 2016 US presidential election that utilized Twitter bots and social network analysis to address political polarization, burst filter bubbles, and bring people together for virtual dialogue about polarizing issues.</p>
<p>Throughout all these experiences, despite the number of bots, mobile devices, or automated learning modules, I found technology and program designs were only as good as the people and values behind them. As it turns out, there is evidence to back this up. My love-letter-faxing sister, <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/">Jennifer Brook</a>, is still using tech to make connections, just as a Design Researcher for Dropbox. I recently read one of her <a href="https://content.yudu.com/web/16f77/0A432f8/SchoolOfLife2017/html/index.html?page=80&amp;origin=reader">reports</a> where her research team uncovered a key characteristic of successful, tech-enabled teams is an explicit <a href="http://jenniferbrook.com/work/prototyping-peace">social contract</a>, or an articulation of what values inform their approach and how they work together.</p>
<p>Incidentally, DIAL is one of the biggest proponents of social contracts in the digital development space. As steward of the <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org">Principles for Digital Development</a>, DIAL advocates for ecosystem actors to recognize, commit to, and become <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/">signatories</a> of generally accepted standards of technology for development. Internally, DIAL not only practices the Digital Principles, but has developed an organizational social contract, what we call our Values Agreement, to inform and evaluate our work. From business operations meetings, decisions about future investments, strategy discussions, design and work planning, even down to program-specific monitoring, evaluation, and learning plans, DIAL team-members strive to highlight and work by the values we’ve articulated and signed onto.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16807 size-full" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="1908" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1.jpg 4032w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-768x363.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/values-1-1024x485.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a>These conversations are not always easy, but having an explicit values agreement gives us a north-star to guide us though this challenging work. In an era of unintended consequences in official development assistance, social contracts like the Digital Principles and internal value agreements help DIAL and other ecosystem partners ethically and intentionally realize the vision of a world in which the underserved benefit from digital technology.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hello,<br />
I am Chhavi. I have mostly been helping around with all things design in MetaBrainz. I recently graduated from IIT Guwahati, India and started contributing to MusicBrainz after attending the summit last year, around the same time.</p>
<p>As a Google Summer of Code student, my project was to <a href="https://community.metabrainz.org/t/gsoc-2018-react-based-ui-component-library/364623">build a design system</a> with React UI components for the upcoming overhaul of MusicBrainz&#8217;s website. It surely was a really interesting journey, right from when I heard about the community and I would like to share some snippets of it with you!</p>
<p><strong>May 2017:</strong> I hear about Picard, and how a bunch of really cool people who meet online are building it. I was intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>Around August 2017:</strong> I pop in the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Communication/IRC">IRC channel</a> #metabrainz, and after much overthinking, I drop a &#8220;Hi&#8221;. Followed was a really warm welcome by people I will soon call friends and a lot of developer-y jargon I had no clue about.</p>
<p><strong>September 2017:</strong> I attend the annual <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2017/11/03/metabrainz-summit-17/">MusicBrainz developer summit</a> in Barcelona. And boy oh boy, I am now part of the family. Over the few days there, I have immense fun interacting and learning from the community.</p>
<p><strong>November 2017:</strong> We set up our <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5&amp;view=detail&amp;selectedIssue=MBS-9652">JIRA ticket system</a> for design issues and start working on the mockups for the redesign. The entire community comes together on JIRA tickets and Discourse posts to talk about where we want to go with this overhaul.</p>
<p><strong>January 2018:</strong> Community members encourage me to try my hand at front-end development. One is really lucky to find people, who encourage you to grow out of your comfort zone and help you cross that wall. In MetaBrainz, there is no shortage of such kind of people.</p>
<p><strong>March 2018:</strong> With little confidence and lots of hopes, I apply for the Google Summer of Code programme. I start learning the ropes of development, with help of online tutorials and obviously our community. We also met for a <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2018/03/26/delhi-mini-summit-2018/">mini-summit in Delhi</a> to discuss ListenBrainz and spicy food.</p>
<p><strong>April 2018:</strong> Hence began my full-fledged journey of learning and spending a summer of coding. It wasn&#8217;t easy, but I learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p>We set up the initial design system using react-bootstrap and react-storybook. I then started importing UI components into the system, followed by its documentation. I wrote up a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chhavijustme/8feddbe5016365e2d6757a3605607fb9">more detailed description of the process</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>August 2018:</strong> As of now, we have the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/design-system">design system</a> in place. The future plan is to continue adding components to it as well focus on having well thought contributing guidelines. I will also continue working on designing the mockups for the user interface for various entities.</p>
<p>Google Summer of Code was just another milestone in my journey with MetaBrainz. My time here has been a time of both personal and professional growth. I now feel more comfortable in a development environment, the ongoing chats on IRC make more sense to me and I feel less inhibited to put my thoughts out there. I completed my college, moved cities, traveled… all while having a set of these amazing people I call family.</p>
<p>A special shout out to Rob for keeping me going, bitmap for being ever so patient and understanding, samj1912 for introducing me to MetaBrainz, CatQuest, iliekcomputers, Suyash, Freso, reo and zas for being amazing friends through it all.</p>
<p>The thing I like about our community is, we had seasoned developers as well as newbies like me, all together working together to create amazing stuff. Hoping to continue being an involved and colorful part of this community,</p>
<p>You will obviously keep hearing from me in the coming days,<br />
Chhavi</p>

        <p>Many moons ago people clamoured for a way for them to use MusicBrainz via their old FreeDB (and others) enabled players. The hope was that this would be a short term solution as more players picked up MusicBrainz support so we created the FreeDB gateway that allowed old clients to use an ancient interface to look up CDs with MusicBrainz.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2007/06/25/freedb-musicbrainz-gateway-now-available/">maintaining this gateway for over 11 years now</a> and recently we had a user asking questions about their new music player and that they were having a hard time getting it to work with our FreeDB gateway.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Someone is developing specifically for a stop-gap measure? Clearly the goal of FreeDB gateway has been misconceived and people are not treating it as a gateway to using the proper MusicBrainz API endpoints.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re no longer keen on supporting this gateway and have been having trouble finding volunteers to maintain it. Our internal staff has enough to do with our own duties and have no interest in further maintaining this and neither do I.</p>
<p>For these reasons the FreeDB gateway is going away in 6 months time; March 18 will be the absolute last day that the gateway will be functioning. Should something crash and the gateway experience problems before then, we&#8217;ll just kill the VM that the gateway is running on and call it a day.</p>
<p>11 years of temporary is enough &#8212; if you use this service, migrate to a proper MusicBrainz endpoint <strong>right now</strong>!</p>

<p>The original post was featured on GSMA Conference Confidential and can be found <a href="http://cc.gsma.com/digital-inclusion-the-role-of-the-mobile-network-operator-in-africa/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Mobile 360 Africa series brings together leaders from Africa’s technology and telecom industries for one of Africa’s largest gathering of technology practitioners. Mobile network operators, donors, development partners, technology companies and startups all convene to engage in thought provoking conversations and showcase innovations that can take Africa to the next level of technology advancement.</p>
<p>The recent Mobile 360 Africa series was held in the land of a thousand hills: Rwanda. Hosted at the Kigali Convention Centre, I had the privilege of having a one-on-one fireside chat with Phillip Amoateng, the phenomenal advocate for mobile internet skills in Airtel CEO for Rwanda.</p>
<p>The fireside chat, <strong>‘Digital Inclusion: The role of the operator in Africa,’</strong> took place during the session <strong>‘Is the Digital Landscape Inclusive for All.’</strong> In this increasingly connected and digital world, consumers are using a wide range of mobile-enabled services for education, agriculture, health, finance and utilities. But despite significant growth in mobile usage across developed regions, in low- and middle-income countries, certain segments of society are being left behind: women, individuals with less education, rural residents, and the poor account for a disproportionate number of those not connected.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have seen increased investments in infrastructure and growth of mobile subscriptions. But it’s not just infrastructure that needs continued investments – users still exhibit limited user capabilities, with most adults in low- and middle-income countries not having basic digital skills and competences. Across Africa, seven in ten people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it. Even in Europe, 19 percent of adults lack the literacy skills, and 45 percent lack the basic digital skills, needed to function fully in a modern society. Interestingly, women are 1.6 times more likely than men to report lack of digital skills as a factor limiting their use of the internet.</p>
<p>Thus, it was interesting to learn from Phillip about the strides that Airtel Rwanda has taken in enhancing mobile internet skills training in a quest to enhance the ability of users to use basic internet applications, understand internet bundles and how to check balances.</p>
<p>On the Mobile Internet Skills Training pilot that Airtel conducted in Rwanda, which reached a quarter of a million subscribers with 300 agents, Phillip said it was encouraging to see first-time internet users discover the value of internet based applications. Tigo sales agents were trained by Airtel/Tigo staff, who then in turn, trained customers that visited their shops.</p>
<p><strong><em>“We learned that customers once taught, would create a ripple effect by training other community embers within their circle.”</em></strong></p>
<p>And the benefit of creating a learning environment is transformative.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Being internet literate is not just about being online but also being available for opportunities. Apart from being in constant contact with friends and families there are also economic benefits and opportunities such as new and better jobs. We highlight the value of the internet as a means of enhancing opportunities for jobs, learning, and business, and more.”</em></strong></p>
<p>We also discussed the roles MNOs can play in addressing challenges of affordability and digital skills training. MNOs can leverage partnerships with education institutions and non-formal education structures to enhance mobile internet skills training. With increasing smart phone penetration, apps will make learning internet skills easier.</p>
<p>As I left the Better Future Stage having had such an insightful conversation with Phillip, I wondered what would happen if all mobile network operators integrated mobile internet skills training for mobile users, particularly those within the low literacy bracket. The number of digitally illiterate Africans would drastically reduce and create more opportunities for communication, learning, jobs and businesses. The future of mobile internet is vast and it’s up to us to make sure everyone is included in its benefits.</p>

        <p>A short story on how things changed.</p><p>2017 was a massive year in my life as a developer. It brought about no small changes both in how I go about writing code as well as how I interact with other developers. The one thing that “<strong>matter</strong><em>ed the</em> <strong>most</strong>” is <strong>collaboration</strong>.<strong> 🙌</strong> It’s not just that open source development demands a greater degree of collaboration, but the acceleration of open source as a movement on all ends during the past few years has actually redefined how software development is done. It became a highly collaborative process with distributed version control systems everywhere. 🌍</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*v5o3JVZVH_74c8gl-k6Pmw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Open source ❤️</figcaption></figure><p>This totally changed the way I write code 💻 . To begin with, it has helped me <em>organise my development workflow</em>. For example, when I want to work on a bug fix or a new feature, I can <strong>branch</strong> off anytime. While <strong>Git</strong> has had an impact on how I personally write code, what has transformed software development into a truly collaborative process has been the rise of code hosting services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Team Services</a>, which provide tools for implementing a collaboration <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">workflow</a> based on Git, with work isolated into branches, organized into commits and documented with commit messages.</p><p>Google Summer of Code 2017 was the one major thing in my life that totally changed it. 😇 I was initially only hoping to finish up the project to 💰 gain money. Only now do I understand that money is the least of the goodies from GSoC. To start with, it gave me new friends 👬 and connections. That is the huge part of the deal. Being a GSoC alumni, you can dive into any of the GSoC summits taking place everywhere in the world. Although I haven't attended any yet, I’m planning on visiting somewhere next year. I’m so thankful to my mentors for patiently <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/we-all-have-bad-days-f59a334f0641">bearing with me through GSoC</a>. Our interaction during the small period of three months brought about some of the most interesting changes in my life. I was offered a contract as a part time freelancer while still being in college. That moment when you really can pay your bills 🎉 was epic. I worked for almost an year of college and it never felt burdening as some of my friends said it would. 😏</p><p>Then comes Mozilla 🦊 into my life. 20th November 2017, marks the day we applied for Mozilla Open Source Support. We were initially so skeptical about the deal and were not sure how much our project aligns to Mozilla’s 🔐 privacy guidelines. Our product wasn’t much focused on privacy, so we had our doubts. We waited patiently through the first couple of months and then lost our hope gradually. But, miraculously, 😍 they reached out to us after five months with the news that I was awarded with the Mozilla Open Source Support Award 2017. By the time I was aware of the news, our project was halfway done. This really eased things up for me. Although the total period of the project was a whopping 12 months, we finished it up in almost half the time thanks to my enthusiastic mentors.</p><p>I never attended a college placement as I wasn’t keen on doing a full time job and wanted to continue as a freelancer. I also have plans for higher studies, so I didn’t want to pull myself into job woes 😩. Initially, I regretted my decision for not attending on-campus placements soon after I left college. Almost all of my friends were busy starting their new lives at companies. It felt so lonely and disturbing. That was the moment I decided to go full out on the search for a job. With about two years of open source record on my resume, it wasn’t that difficult to gain a job in the world outside of placements. I was contacted by atleast 20 companies in the span of a month and I started making choices. I attended 3 interviews and got selected 💃 in two of them. By the end of the month, I had two opportunities to choose from. Then, came my saviour, ❤️Lasse, one of my mentors from GSoC. He brought to me another opportunity to work with a community of people I’ve already known from GSoC. Imagine how refreshing 😍 it would feel to continue working with people whom you already love to work with. I dished out all other options and went with my mentor. I never had the thought that landing a job would be this effortless, provided you have good connections. And a GSoC really helped me get those good connections. I kind of hoped that “making choices” part would come to my life at some point. But, I never knew that it would be so early in life. (I am still 20 😁)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/666/1*77t4yNKlgeHMN1selgRqlA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Welcome to the Dark Side.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>I hope your journey into open source would be as enriching for you as it has been for me.</blockquote><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f5a1e4f6417d" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/how-open-source-turned-my-life-around-f5a1e4f6417d">How Open Source turned my Life Around.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the technology field, late Summer and early Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere is the traditional conference season &#8212; a time for colleagues to pause to reconnect with each other, learn about trends and challenges in the industry, and of course, build new relationships and strengthen old ones. For the past 20 years now, one of the biggest of these gatherings of creators and consumers of open source software has been the O&#8217;Reilly Open Source Convention (<a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or">OSCON</a>). DIAL&#8217;s Open Source Center team just returned from the event in Portland, Oregon, and once again left informed and refreshed as open source enters its third decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16226 size-medium" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OSCON-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As Director of Community for the DIAL <a href="http://www.osc.dial.community/">Open Source Center</a>, I primarily focus on the power of people to build technology to improve the reach and impact of international development and humanitarian response work, and to bring people in our field together to tackle new problems and find new ways to collaborate. That&#8217;s why the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/">Community Leadership Summit</a>, held each year just before OSCON, was particularly valuable this year. An &#8220;unconference&#8221;, the content of the event is driven by participants. I hosted the &#8220;Beyond Fiscal Sponsors&#8221; session, where experts honed in on the challenges and gaps faced by open source software projects and how organizations like DIAL and our Open Source Center can fill those gaps and amplify the impact of software projects &#8212; not only in the development &amp; humanitarian sectors, but also in all types of open source work.</p>
<p>Two days of tutorials and in-depth workshops followed for the team, on topics from giving better technical presentations, to coaching engineering team members, to technology platforms like Kubernetes, containers, and continuous delivery. Finally, there were two days of keynotes and shorter technical talks, enabling us learn about the work of our open source colleagues around the world as the develop best practices.</p>
<p>Of course, there were many exciting conve<a href="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16228 alignright" src="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-300x225.jpg 300w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-768x576.jpg 768w, https://digitalimpactalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JOBBOARD-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>rsations for our team along the way. David McCann, the Center&#8217;s Director of Technology, sat down with O&#8217;Reilly Media to talk a little bit about the United Nations Foundation, DIAL, and how the Open Source Center is working to turbocharge projects in the international development space. Check out the interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgekpgk2Uc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the weeklong event, the entire team &#8212; including the newest member of our team, Heath Arensen, was able to meet and brainstorm with key players in the tech industry about how we might adapt the lessons they&#8217;ve learned to build more financially sustainable open source software projects with long-lasting impact. We had great discussions sharing success stories and ideas for how to strengthen this invaluable effort to build even more technology capacity and launch more technology careers for women, people in the Global South, and other under-represented groups.</p>
<p>On the final day of the week, I presented a talk about the DIAL Open Source Center, how open source software is being used in critical humanitarian and development world in every part of the world, and how we&#8217;re helping to mitigate some of the risk involved by providing additional resources and services to those projects.</p>
<p>Conferences are major investments of time and energy, but the time spent on forging new relationships and partnerships, as well as teaching others about what we&#8217;ve learned, helps to increase the impact of every bit of work we do the rest of the year. Again this year, we were very grateful for the opportunity to be surrounding by thousands of our colleagues for such a vibrant and busy week.</p>

        <p>When I moved to Vermont, I spent a year working as an AmeriCorps/VISTA volunteer on adult literacy, which was a powerful and eye-opening experience into the world of public health and vulnerable populations. It inspired me to go on to medical school, where I learned some important life skills like how to doze off standing up, deliver babies, and how to take on the honor of holding hands with people as they died. After residency I did a fellowship in sports medicine and developed a practice in that field. I continued to practice medicine part-time in urgent care while I moved on to work full-time in the for-profit health informatics industry.</p>
<p>I found the informatics work fascinating, mostly because of the challenges and failures that persisted across practices and hospitals despite access to significant resources and infrastructure. It was surprising to me how much inefficiency and lack of interoperability there was, and most didn’t seem to know how to leverage technology for the sake of better outcomes. There was confusion among the actors around government standards and expectations, even among the governing bodies themselves. While this was my first exposure to challenges faced when integrating tech, it wouldn’t be my last. It’s frustrating to see the potential of technology not be realized in what otherwise seemed like an optimal health care setting.</p>

<p>While I was practicing medicine, I was also starting a family. It was during this phase of my life when my career path solidified. When I first met my oldest son, he was 8 months old and living in an orphanage in Addis Ababa. I’ve since gotten to know his birth mom and her story about making the decision to relinquish him. While my younger son’s story is unique as he was several years older when we first me and from a different region of Ethiopia, his birth family faced similar life-changing challenges. Through our family and our Ethiopian family’s experiences, I was drawn to better understand how it could be that such loving families had to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.</p>
<p>I began volunteering for an NGO that implements programming in Ethiopia, <a href="https://www.whfc.org/">Wide Horizons For Children</a>, focused on reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and empowering families. Many of their projects, which typically focus on health, education and financial stability, utilize digital technology for implementation. This may be in the form of using cell phones to access assessment tools to support health extension workers or data collection for school feeding programs. With limited funding and capacity, this NGO faced some of the same challenges I saw during my time in the for-profit informatics world. On their own, they can’t address their digital technology challenges in a way that would allow them to scale-up, innovate, leverage work from other sectors and reduce redundancy or achieve sustainability.</p>

While here, I’m working on creating public facing documents on what we’ve been calling the Advanced Market Commitment vaccine research. This encompasses the work DIAL did with PATH that investigated the market-shaping mechanisms that changed the way vaccines were procured. It also includes new thinking from DIAL and the Tableau Foundation on drawing lessons learned that can expand access to digital markets. Stay tuned for the release of the research!

        <h4>That was me until the past week.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*P-VQUqX0isRifLoC4M-vEw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Embrace your life. Image credits: Unsplash.com</figcaption></figure><p>It can be frustrating to to hear about how to make your life wonderful by doing things that you can’t necessarily do on a daily basis because of your job or lifestyle. I hear about people travelling all time to far flung places, or spending days outside, and the only thing that I can think of is how unfair it is that I’m cooped up in my home, with the only view of outside being the screen in front of me.</p><p>However, as someone like me who likes to make the most of each day, (not just weekends!), there are a few things I do to make even my most mundane Mondays a little brighter, because I’m a big believer that every day should be made ridiculously amazing!</p><h4>Get up an hour earlier.</h4><p>Yes. I know my friends. We all are insomniacs and stay up all night doing all kinds of things. But, do give it a try, an early sleep and early rise can truly fresh up your day a lot. Use the time to take a stroll down to a park or even just the sidewalk, if you don’t live near any park. Frantically running into showers, driving or walking to the office, and sitting at your desk before your body has even had time to adjust to your new day, only worsens your day. Set yourself a tone for the mellower day, instead.</p><h4>Make a to-do list in the morning.</h4><p>Thanks to few of my colleagues, I recently started writing up to-do lists at work. It feels so refreshing at the end of the day seeing all those check marks. To give it a try, I brought the same change to my life, not just work. It just feels too good to be true, that simple things like these really refresh your day. But this trick really does work.</p><h4>Make movement non-negotiable.</h4><p>Halfway through your morning and through the afternoon, I force myself to standup and walk around. (Couldn’t do that earlier, so, I forced my laptop to go to sleep, if I didn’t have a walk in time.) I’m trying to do this as often as possible. This helped me have a break from all the problems at work. Work is just work to get paid. It shouldn’t be haunting your afterlife.</p><h4>At lunch, get away from your computer.</h4><p>Be in the moment. Enjoy whatever the food you are eating. Get outside and have a walk, read a book or just take in the day for whatever amount of time you can spare.</p><h4>Do something different each evening.</h4><p>This helps in keeping you away from boredom. Routine way of life gets you bored easily. Don’t just come home, eat dinner and relax on the couch. We should mix things up, if anything go for a long drive out into the wilderness, have a hike planned, take your pet for a walk or visit a beach, watch some movies (the kind you have never seen before) or just have bonfires in the backyard. Just because it is “an evening in the weekdays” doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it!</p><h4>Don’t go into an eating rut!</h4><p>Have something you really enjoy for each meal. Even if it it’s something cooked at home, have a change of menu everyday. And I tried cooking something on my own, didn’t turn out to be good, but it really gave me a lot of satisfaction. Plan out some fun dinner, which is both fun to make and eat! Once you start experimenting in the kitchen, it is hard to stop and the possibilities are endless!</p><h4>Reminiscing your day before bed.</h4><p>Be thankful for everything that happened during the day. The most important thing of all these things is to practice mindfulness throughout the day. Even on your way to work, which may seem like the most mundane thing ever, take in the weather, the sounds, the sights. At work, notice the people around you, and make the best of whatever your job might be. You’re there, so may as well make the best of it and take pride in your accomplishments. Our world is always changing, every second of every hour, so make sure you witness as much of it as you can.</p><p>Hope this helps at least someone in their life. If these tricks really helped you too, take time to throw in some claps.

I am currently a sophomore in Bilkent University, Ankara. And I am a member of IEEE Bilkent Student Branch where I’ve met Andreu in Mobile Days, March 2016. I have spent a month in Lleida, Liquid Galaxy Labs.<br /><br />To be honest, this was my first internship and I feel very lucky that I could come here from Turkey and learn a lot of things, meet a lot of people. As a foreign student, having a practice outside my country has been an incredible experience both because I discovered significant concepts on computer science and practiced my three-week Spanish that I started learning last summer in Malaga. Here in the labs, there are also workshops and events and people with different ideas come and share their projects, opinions, tools and technologies they use. For instance Lot Amoros, the creator of Dronecoria Project for reforestation, shared his ideas and we, students also shared our opinions about what can be done. This has been a very valuable experience due to the project and meeting Lot Amoros himself. We also had a workshop concerning Google Assistant and AIY Voice Kit with the participation of teenagers. We prepared quizzes and flashcards with Actions on Google to use on Google Home and Google Home Mini.<br /><br /> In this four-week period, I experienced open source with Liquid Galaxy. My colleague Oscar Carrasco, also a visiting student from University La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, was able to adapt the Liquid Galaxy to chromebooks for the project, Liquid Galaxy for Education. Now, a team of four including me is working on the Android tablet application that will be used for Liquid Galaxy for Education.<br /><br /><br /> As a foreign computer science student, my stay in Lleida has widened my world by all means, and I thank Andreu Ibáñez for this experience and his hospitality!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8bpmp_uejnE/W1BhtWNizcI/AAAAAAAGdk0/UJh5MNONErw0zgk_Ck72sOIvVsR5wkTYwCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180626_150228.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>My experience visiting Lleida<br />Oscar Carrasco</b></span><br />My name is Óscar Carrasco and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna (Tenerife, Spain). <br /><br />I met Andreu in last July, in his TLP Innova conference about Google Summer of Code which really interested me, so I decided to stay in touch with him. We contacted again in November and, one month later, I collaborated with him as a Liquid Galaxy project mentor in the Google Code-in program.<br /><br />This experience was enjoyable to me, so I travelled to Lleida this summer in order to keep developing Open-source software in a project called “Liquid Galaxy for Education”.<br /><br />The first two things that got my attention in Lleida were the blazing hot weather and the lack of sea. Since I’ve been living near the ocean my entire life, it was suffocating not to see it around me. It was hard for me to get used to the climate.<br /><br />The main activity was working in the labs in the morning. We managed to port most of the core Liquid Galaxy features into the Chromebooks during my stance, as it was intended to happen. My partners were also working on improving the legacy Liquid Galaxy Controller Android application during this time.<br /><br />We were also involved in many other tasks. We went to the cinema, had dinner at Punto Estrella, (popular restaurant in Lleida), participated in a local radio channel called UA1, visited a startup called InTech3D and hosted three Google Developer Group meetups in our spare time. And we did all of this in only five days! I had never felt so productive in my entire life.<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c42WO5Vc0_Y/W1BgZ8O7JOI/AAAAAAAGdko/DcAZsk_Ioj0ZxC8rcrPApyunlEYk0RRLwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20180718_153559_Bokeh.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">Deniz left, Oscar right</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">At the end of the summer we'll continue this with histories from the other students, <br />Ivan, Aleks and Albert, from EPS, Lleida.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Meb84ugPlSo/W1BiLvPV20I/AAAAAAAGdlE/sKufGS3oj-MlmwuMQxGXLh_ZqGmi1esmQCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_20180629_133416.jpg" width="640" /></a></div></div>

Liquid Galaxy for Chromebooks installation is 90% developed (with the help of Oscar Carrasco), and Android controller application is on his way.<br /><br />Here we want to offer some task related to the integration of the Google Assistant technology in the Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />- <b>Develop a library to connect the Google Assistant</b>, in his Google home form factor, to the Liquid Galaxy.<br />This will consist on a DialogFlow and a webhook that will connect directly to a master computer on a Liquid Galaxy system.<br /><br />Initially the functionalities we want to see are two:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the Liquid Galaxy to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; places. IE: "Ok Google, go to Izmir, Turkey", for the LG to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; move to Izmir in Turkey.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . Implement voice commands to move the camera. IE: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, move forward" to have the camera moved fwd.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "OK Google, turn right 90 degrees"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or similar actions to implement all the usual movements a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; visitor to a LG installation will do with a Space Navigator<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; joystick.<br /><br />You can see this in action on this video, from student Marcel Porta, showing up the demo he created in 2017 to launch projects on the Liquid Galaxy from a Google Home.<br /><br /><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltqjQC-jMLs" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />In the near future we also want to develop the Google Assistant functionality in the LGxEDU Android app, for launching and playing with the quizes.

        <p>Deploy to AWS EC2 instances using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>So, recently, I’ve been trying to deploy a private repository from GitLab CI/CD pipelines. I couldn’t find an easy way to deploy docker images to EC2 instances. So, I made a workaround of my own using a crazy simple tool we all know of, the <strong>SSH</strong>.</p><p>Through this tutorial, I’m gonna be assuming that you have a working EC2 instance with sudo access to the shell and you already have a docker-compose file ready to set off to production.</p><h4>Setting up EC2 instance</h4><p>SSH into your instance and install docker and docker-compose on it. There are numerous tutorials available online on how to install them. So, I’m not gonna cover that here.</p><p>Once you’ve got them setup, choose a location to place your docker-compose.yml file. Preferably somewhere in /opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt; . So, now, try deploying the compose file directly using docker-compose up -d . Once you’re sure that works, let’s move on to the next step.</p><p>Generate an SSH RSA private/public key pair, that we’re going to use to login from GitLab CI runner and run the deploy script. To generate the key pair, we’ll use ssh-keygen.</p><pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privkey</pre><p>Now, you should have two files, privkey and privkey.pub in your current working directory. Paste the contents of privkey as is (without extra spaces) into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the EC2 instance. Copy the contents of privkey.pub , we’ll be using that later from the gitlab CI.</p><h4>Setting up GitLab CI/CD job</h4><p>I’m gonna show an opinionated GitLab CI configuration file, which we’ll be using to build and deploy the images from master branch of the repository.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p68SyHN3hNK0gkXs7554EA.png" /><figcaption>GitLab CI Configuration.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, we use the GitLab CI preferences pane, where we’ll setup a few environment variables listed below.</p><ul><li>DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY: The contents of privkey.pub which we generated earlier.</li><li>DEPLOY_SERVER_IP : The IP address of the EC2 instance.</li><li>DEPLOY_HOST : The username of the EC2 instance, eg. ubuntu , if you use a ubuntu base image for setting up EC2 instance.</li></ul><p>Make sure that you’ve turned on the protected flag in the variables section for each of the variables to set them only on protected branches like master.</p><p>From the GitLab CI configuration file, you can see that there is a script .ci/deploy.sh on the repository which we’ll be using to run for deployments. It can be something like this.</p><pre># .ci/deploy.sh</pre><pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash<br />set -x -e -o pipefail</pre><pre>COMPOSE_LOCATION="/opt/&lt;your_app_name&gt;/master"<br />DOCKER_GROUP_NAME="docker"</pre><pre># Early checks<br />which docker<br />which docker-compose<br />id -nG | grep "$DOCKER_GROUP_NAME"</pre><pre># Start deployment<br />cd $COMPOSE_LOCATION<br />docker-compose pull<br />docker-compose up -d</pre><p>That’s it, you’re done setting up CD with GitLab.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5e215154730f" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/ship-it-5e215154730f">Ship it!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Los Chromebooks son generalmente portátiles de potencia media y fácil uso con su sistema operativo Chrome OS, bajo coste de adquisición, mantenimiento y gestión, y que están muy orientados al mercado educativo.<br /><br />El software estará compuesto primero por el core Liquid Galaxy instalado en los Chromeboosk bajo Crouton, un software que permite la instalación de Linux muy fácil y rápidamente, y que será ejecutado a la vez que el Chrome OS. Aparte está definiéndose y desarrollándose una aplicación Android para ser ejecutaba en una tableta de 7 a 10", y que dispondrá de los controles del sistema, así como de una aplicación educativa abierta, que vendrá precargada de material educativo para Geografía e Historia y que permitirá a los profesores expandir los contenidos por ellos mismos.<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white;

        <h2 id="how-it-all-began-">How It All Began ?</h2> <p>I had been contributing to <a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit">scancode-toolkit</a> for quite a while and it took me a few months to get accustomed to the codebase. It was the 12th February, 2018 and the list of accepted mentoring organizations was published. I booted up my laptop in excitement to give the list a glance. When I scrolled through, I was unable to find AboutCode (the organization I was contributing to) in the roll. I was devastated at the unfortunate event and spent the next few hours pondering over my endeavour since the past couple of months.</p> <p>I had always dreamt of becoming a DOUBLE GSOCER and I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. This would mean I would have to reiterate the entire process, i.e. shortlist an organization and start contributing from scratch ! After a heavy setback, I decided to continue with the struggle and not give up on my aspiration. I found <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)</a> which is an open standard for communicating software bill of material information (including components, copyrights, and security references). I spent the next few weeks exploring the Python library to parse, validate and create SPDX documents and preparing mockups. Since the project involved lexing and parsing, I had to comprehend the fundamentals of compiler theory. Fast forward to the judgement day; I was busy refreshing the GSoC page, in the middle of the road, with my friend to check the result and here’s what it displayed:</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance.png" /> </figure> <p>Furthermore, I received a mail from Google confirming my selection for the paramount program.</p> <figure> <img src="https://yash-nisar.github.io/images/gsoc18_acceptance_mail.png" /> </figure> <h2 id="whats-next-">What’s next ?</h2> <p>The community bonding period is almost over with just a week remaining. I have almost completed upgrading the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Document</code> class and initiated a few bug fixes. I would like to heartily thank my mentors <a href="https://github.com/pombredanne">@pombredanne</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krysnuvadga">@krysnuvadga</a> for keeping faith in me throughout the process and giving me the opportunity to be a part of the SPDX community. I’m super excited to spend this summer with SPDX and intend to use this blog to post updates and developments.</p>

      <i class="author"></i>
      <div class="content">
        <h2 id="tldr-why-the-title">TLDR; Why the title?</h2> <p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos. Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p> <ul> <li>I know what I can do: <ul> <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li> <li>Write more regularly.</li> <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li> <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li> <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li> <li>Read more books.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I don’t know what I would do: <ul> <li>Do I go for a job after B.tech? <ul> <li>If yes, then do I need to do something differently from what I am currently doing?</li> </ul> </li> <li>or, I should rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? <ul> <li>If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</li> </ul> </li> <li>and moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me? <ul> <li>Is it lethargy? <ul> <li>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my free time doing these things.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I too busy? <ul> <li>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a few friends, I don’t really do much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not put in enough efforts? <ul> <li>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do I not have enough resources? <ul> <li>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to advice me.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Am I just slow? <ul> <li>Yes, probably.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2> <p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p> <ul> <li>What stream after High School? <ul> <li>Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</li> <li>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences either.</li> <li>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in other people’s calculation.</li> <li>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What college do you want to go to?</p> <p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for B.Tech program - My rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option. I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2> <p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training. But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into consideration.</p> <p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions” wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes, because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the “optimum” choice.</p> <p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure). The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment” then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p> <p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? - What about MS?</p> <p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be selected, am I too late?</p> <h3 id="solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3> <p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p> <ul> <li>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</li> <li>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</li> <li>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long “thought drills”</li> <li>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely find a way to a solution.</li> </ul> <p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>

        <p>During PyCon India, I had the privilege to meet Sanyam (<a href="https://github.com/CuriousLeaner">@CuriousLeaner</a>), whom I already knew as a mentor to many in the #dgplug community, when he visited the coala community space. We had a short discussion about How to nurture Open Source Communities in college? It was then, when @crancg got him to join the slack for AMU-OSS. And then, one wild day we invited Sanyam to come speak at our college and share his insights on OSS and the following event was born.</p> <p><img alt="Group_Photo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15556382/36986480-eacc15be-20bf-11e8-98d0-9ed9c9331f4b.jpg" /></p> <h2 id="what-happened-there">What happened there?</h2> <h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Free and Open Source Software</h3> <p>The first part of the session consisted of an introduction to the concept of Free and Open Source Software, and was chaired by Sanyam - the students were made aware of the importance of FOSS in the world. He and the other mentors also took questions and cleared the doubts of students regarding the world of open source.</p> <h3 id="how-to-build-an-add-on-for-mozilla">How to build an Add-on for Mozilla?</h3> <p>The second part of the session was a hands-on technical event, and the students were taught how to implement an add-on (extension) for Mozilla Firefox. The importance of extensions for adding functionality to any browser was stressed, and the students were encouraged to build their own add-ons and to get them published.</p> <h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3> <p>The final part of the event involved the mentors explaining how students could contribute to open source, and how the community was always looking to better itself through the contributions of new and young talent. The talk was inspirational and the students in attendance seemed motivated and encouraged to become a part of the development community.</p> <h2 id="vote-of-thanks">Vote of Thanks</h2> <p>First of all, I would like to thank Sanyam, Shashank and Shivam for coming to the event and inspiring students. A huge shoutout to @crancg for having established AMU-OSS. I would also like to express my gratitude towards Mr. Zafaryab Sir, who is always enthusiastic about such initiatives without whom the event would never have been possible.

        <p>Over the past few years I’ve become an avid supporter of FOSS and the open-source community, and it became a goal of mine to start contributing to the open-source world. <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code-In</a> seemed like the perfect opportunity to help me achieve this goal (and much sooner than I thought!), so I signed up without hesitation.</p><p>Once the contest began, I had to choose my first task. I picked a task from <a href="https://coala.io">coala</a> because, well, I thought “coala” was a cute name. coala is a handy tool that can lint and often fix problems in your source code. They have a very helpful guide for newcomers too, making it easy for anyone to get started with contributing.</p><p>My first task was a coding task, but the process of using git and creating tests proved far tougher than writing the main piece of code. I made a lot of mistakes in these areas, and didn’t do things quite the way I should have been doing them, but with some help from my mentors my work was eventually merged, and I had made my first contribution. Success!</p><p>Almost a month later, and I’ve completed an array of different tasks and learnt a ton of new stuff. School, exams and other priorities meant I couldn’t dedicate as much time as I would have liked to Code-In, but I made sure to attempt a variety of different tasks in different areas. Naturally, I encountered difficulties on almost every task — there was a lot of time spent meticulously reading through source code in an attempt to understand things, and I lost count of the number of times I had to ask for extensions. These difficulties are of course key to improving and amongst other things, I’ve finally got the hang of git, I’ve dabbled with graphics and regex for the first time, and (after several run-ins with coala’s linting bears) I’ve learnt to write cleaner and better code.</p><p>But I think the most important things I have learnt come from the experience of working within a real-life organisation. The process I had to go through in order to understand and build upon existing code taught me a lot, and using various tools to complete my tasks has given me valuable practical skills and knowledge that will no doubt be helpful in the future.</p><p>I’m incredibly grateful to the mentors at coala for providing very detailed and justified feedback where necessary, answering questions and helping me to resolve any problems. Working with such knowledgeable and friendly people has been extremely rewarding, and I hope to continue contributing to the organisation.</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank Google for making this wonderful experience possible. I’m a little sad that I didn’t find out about GCI sooner as I’ll be too old to participate again next year, but nonetheless, I have had a lot of fun and look forward to diving deeper into the world of OSS!</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ba254d19ce28" width="1" />

Well, as you know everyone loves <a href="http://webpack.js.org"><strong>webpack</strong></a> and <a href="https://brunch.io"><strong>brunch</strong></a>. But, this baby 👶 gives a rock solid support for simple things whenever you want it.</p><p>I gotta admit, the zero-config stuff is really enticing. Especially, when you’re just getting started with JavaScript and web development in general. It has built in asset packaging and hot module reloading.</p><p>But, it really is only as powerful as the config-less aproach is. For medium and large scale projects, as everyone would speak out, going for brunch or webpack is the better idea.</p><pre>$ yarn global add parcel-bundler</pre><p>However, getting started with parceljs is as simple as installing parceljs bundler and writing an index page with some javascript.</p><pre>index.html</pre><pre>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br /> &lt;script src="./index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</pre><pre>index.js</pre><pre>console.log('Welcome to parcel.js');</pre><p>Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports <a href="https://parceljs.org/hmr.html">hot module replacement</a> for fast development. Just point it at your entry file:</p><pre>parcel index.html</pre><p>Now open <a href="http://localhost:1234/">http://localhost:1234/</a> in your browser. You can also override the default port with the -p &lt;port number&gt; option.</p><p>Use the development server when you don’t have your own server, or your app is entirely client rendered. If you do have your own server, you can run Parcel in watch mode instead. This still automatically rebuilds as files change and supports hot module replacement, but doesn't start a web server.</p><pre>parcel watch index.html</pre><p>When you’re ready to build for production, the build mode turns off watching and only builds once. See the <a href="https://parceljs.org/production.html">Production</a> 🚀 section for more details.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4958afe5ba3e" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots/boilerplates-are-fun-right-4958afe5ba3e">Boilerplates are fun, right?!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/my-new-roots">My New Roots..</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

        <p>So sometime ago i added a foreign key column as a rails migration which creates an index on that column as well: through the <code>add_foreign_key</code> method. This index is of the form <code>rails_fk_some_hex</code> Unfortunately i forgot to add a unique constraint with the index which was a necessary use case.</p> <p>I thought ‘no big deal’ i’ll just add that now, i ran:</p> <pre>add_index :table_name, :column_name, unique: true, index_name: :some_name</pre> <p>and viola it worked on my local machine like a charm. It even removed the previous index on that column that the foreign key migration created.</p> <p>but running this on staging. I had 2 indexes, 1 unique and 1 non unique -_- .</p> <p><strong>Little debugging and i could confirm a pattern</strong>:</p> <p>If these 2 migrations occur in the same <code>rails db:migrate</code> then the <code>add_index</code> migration also overwrites the index created by the <code>foreign_key</code> migration. However in different migrations, it just adds another index.</p> <p><b>Solution</b>:</p> <p>I’m not sure if this is a feature or a bug. To solve for the cases where migrations run together(dev machines) or on servers where they are run separately I used <code>remove_index</code> if <code>index_exists?</code> .</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>This isn’t something “breaking or a huge discovery”, just something weird i found in my Rails Journey and something you should be aware about.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><br /> <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com/383/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=learningstuffeveryday.wordpress.com&amp;blog=108096159&amp;post=383&amp;subd=learningstuffeveryday&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

        <h1 id="how-to-get-started-with-self-driving-cars">How to get started with self driving cars?</h1> <p>I’ve asked myself (and Google) this question numerous times and have always learned something new in the process which in turn has lead to a superficial learning of autonomous technology — helping me getting a taste of it, but for a deeper knowledge on the subject, I must complete courseware, develop some projects for hands on experience and in the process network with people who have seasoned this art who can help me get a better insight on the current trends in research and industry.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gYTE7HBbZokfRhXMDB7VUg.gif" /></p> <h2 id="courseware">COURSEWARE</h2> <p>I’ve completed my home work of figuring out a Coursework for conquering the world of Self Driving Cars:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://rj722.tech/deeplearning.ai">Deep Learning specialisation</a></li> <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a></li> <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344">Intro to parallel Programming</a></li> <li><a href="http://rj722.tech/cs231n.stanford.edu">CS231N</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot">mobile-robot</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0">Underactuated robotics</a></li> <li>https://www.udacity.com/apollo (Yet to start)</li> </ul> <p>I haven’t included the Udacity self driving car Nanodegree program (although, it is a great resource) because it is quite expensive. Every course listed here is either freely available or can be audited free of cost as of January, 2018.</p> <h2 id="projects">PROJECTS:</h2> <p>This is actually the most exciting and important part, as not only do I gain hands on experience on how things work here and the workflow involved, but it also allows me to build a portfolio around automotive technology which, I can then showcase to the potential employers.</p> <p>It is important to take note of the fact that laying down a clear goal of a project before you start it yields better results and agreeably, it’s easy to track progress if you quantify things. For example, if your todo list currently says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be - Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear as possible when posing a project statement.</p> <p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Develop a brain for a self driving car</strong> <ul> <li>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a road scene.</li> <li>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</li> <li>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this neural network.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</strong> <ul> <li>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</li> <li>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a particular road in GTA-5.</li> <li>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>A completely self driving RC car</strong> <ul> <li>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</li> <li>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and preferably until battery dies.</li> <li>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</li> <li>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</li> <li>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the curriculum of the various courses.</li> </ul> <h2 id="some-extra-fun-to-dos">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2> <ul> <li>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics</li> <li>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity</li> <li>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</li> <li>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</li> </ul> <p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be! I’ll keep you updated with detailed reports on projects I make.</p>

Many have turned them off completely for that.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5f6"><a href="https://gitmate.io/">We (GitMate.io)</a> are constantly researching about how people handle a flood of incoming issues in our aim to improve the situation by <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gitmate.io/features" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">applying modern technologies</a> to the problem. (Oh and we love free software!)</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0e78">By analyzing the biggest open source repositories on GitHub (more info on the data below) we’ve seen that the contributors to any of those projects responds to only 2.3% of all issues on average. (Let a contributor be a person that commented on at least two issues which they didn’t open.)</p> <figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="f4c5"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"> <div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div> <div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" height="50" width="75"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R4S6yIEqW1vNJ-S3Xx4R6Q.png" /></div> </div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Contributor Interest Histogram (Summed over the biggest repositories)</figcaption></figure> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="69d5">This makes clear that for any bigger open source project, “Watching” the repository is resulting in a lot of spam for most of the people. If they don’t respond, notifying them was of no value for the discussion after all.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8d2">We can also observe that only very few project managers care for any significant portion of the issues. Only 6 of our human contributors in total care for more than every 5th issue at all. Here’s our heros:</p> <pre class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p" id="dffd">25.05%: golang/go -&gt; ianlancetaylor, Watching 47.48%: moby/moby -&gt; thaJeztah, Watching 27.31%: moby/moby -&gt; cpuguy83, Watching 36.67%: owncloud/core -&gt; PVince81, Not watching 47.12%: saltstack/salt -&gt; gtmanfred, Watching 25.54%: saltstack/salt -&gt; Ch3LL, Watching</pre> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre" id="d310">However, we do see that 29.1% (117) of all contributors (402) are still subscribed to all notifications of the repository (watching it).</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="8105">Switching to Polling</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="aef0">Many contributors switch to polling instead of watching the main repository.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a2e">However, we still see that the main maintainers keep watching the repository: without them, it’s very easy to miss out on new issues and it’s hard to make sure that the right people take a look at the right issues in a decentralized system.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f8d0">Introducing Automation</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="3a99">In many communities we see home grown bots arising that apply labels and sometimes assign people based on keywords. This works especially well for automatically created issues (e.g. from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentry</a>) but is not a full solution.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e029">We’ve tried it. Contributors started mentioning keywords consciously and it didn’t really work for user reported issues.</p> <h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="cb2a">Better Automation!</h4> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a947">We wouldn’t be GitMate if we didn’t strive for more. Our data suggests that people are spending way too much time on their notifications. We’ve maintained <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://coala.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">coala.io</a> in the past and we know that reading through all of them is impossible even for core maintainers. Static keyword based automation doesn’t seem to be enough.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="35b4">Since quite a while we’re hacking on an artificial intelligence that helps you dealing with this problem by analyzing exactly what every person in your team is discussing about on GitHub or GitLab and mentioning the ones who are important for solving any new issue.</p> <p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf53">GitMate is built as a full automated triaging solution.

We’ve excluded ‘ZeroK-RTS/CrashReports’ because no humans seem to be operating that repository.

        <p>I’ve always loved programming, and doing it socially on GitHub makes things even better. Although I was already a member of several small organizations, such as <a href="https://github.com/gitpoint">GitPoint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Chaosthebot">ChaosTheBot</a> and my local FIRST Robotics Team, this is my first experience working with a really large organizations — in my case, <a href="https://github.com/coala">coala</a>. It’s an amazing experience, so I’m incredibly grateful to <a href="https://g.co/gci">Google Code-In</a> for the opportunity.</p><p>Working with everyone at coala has been fantastic. Not only have I been introduced to a wonderful and powerful code linter (which I’ve already started to implement into my existing code bases), I’ve also learned a ton about Python, unit tests, coala’s commit guidelines and probably most importantly, how to work in a large-scale team environment.</p><p>In the Google Code-In competition, students claim bite-sized “tasks” that usually involve solving a specific bug or adding a feature to one of their organization’s projects. Before “claiming” a task (committing to work on that specific issue) it’s generally good to research how you might go about it and what kinds of external tools or resources might be able to help you. For example, before I claimed a task involving the generation of an RSS feed for one of coala’s websites, I first found an NPM module that could easily create the feed and then read the documentation thoroughly to make sure I understood the module’s usage. At that point, I felt comfortable enough with the technology to claim the task.</p><p>If you are pushing yourself, eventually, you will run into a problem while solving a task. That’s totally fine. The mentors are there to help you overcome any barriers you may come across. I’ve ran into difficulties and had questions about a task several times, but contacting the coala mentors on Zulip or Gitter was very simple, and, after they get back to me quickly, we always work out a good solution. I’m very fortunate to have a huge team of mentors at coala who are willing to provide loads of feedback for even the smallest change, too. Learning directly from professionals in the programming industry has helped me become a better developer and improve my coding habits and abilities.</p><p>If you’re interested in coala, get involved by solving some newcomer issues. Once you’re comfortable, choose tasks in the coala repositories with a higher difficulty. The difficulty system set up in coala repositories is very helpful when you’re just starting off, as all issues are given a rating from newcomer, to low, to medium, to high, and you can pick and choose the issues with a rating you’re comfortable with.</p><p>Overall, coala has given me a stronger appreciation for all open source software, developers and maintainers while also helping me improve my own programming abilities. I’m very happy to be a member of the team and look forward to continuing to work with them well after this year’s Google Code-In competition is complete. Who knows, maybe in a few years I’ll be able to mentor the next generation of coala developers in their Google Code-In journey, and hopefully help them have just as good of a time as I’ve been having.</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=174c83855630" width="1" />
